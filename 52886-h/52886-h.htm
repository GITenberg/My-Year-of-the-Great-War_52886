<h2><a id="PREFACE"></a>TO THE READER</h2>
</div>

<p>In “The Last Shot,” which appeared only a few
months before the Great War began, drawing from
my experience in many wars, I attempted to describe
the character of a conflict between two great European
land-powers, such as France and Germany.</p>

<p>“You were wrong in some ways,” a friend writes
to me, “but in other ways it is almost as if you had
written a play and they were following your script
and stage business.”</p>

<p>Wrong as to the duration of the struggle and its
bitterness; right about the part which artillery would
play; right in suggesting the stalemate of intrenchments
when vast masses of troops occupied the length
of a frontier. Had the Germans not gone through
Belgium and attacked on the shorter line of the Franco-German
boundary, the parallel of fact with that of
prediction would have been more complete. As for
the ideal of “The Last Shot,” we must await the outcome
to see how far it shall be fulfilled by a lasting
peace.</p>

<p>Then my friend asks, “How does it make you
feel?” Not as a prophet; only as an eager observer,
who finds that imagination pales beside reality.
If sometimes an incident seemed a page out of my
novel, I was reminded how much better I might have
done that page from life; and from life I am writing
now.</p>

<p>I have seen too much of the war and yet not enough
to assume the pose of a military expert; which is easy
when seated in a chair at home before maps and news
despatches, but becomes fantastic after one has lived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
at the front. One waits on more information before
he forms conclusions about campaigns. He is certain
only that the Marne was a decisive battle for civilisation;
that if England had not gone into the war the
Germanic Powers would have won in three months.</p>

<p>No words can exaggerate the heroism and sacrifice
of the French or the importance of the part which the
British have played, which we shall not realise till the
war is over. In England no newspapers were suppressed;
casualty lists were given out; she gave publicity
to dissensions and mistakes which others concealed,
in keeping with her ancient birthright of free
institutions which work out conclusions through discussion
rather than taking them ready-made from any
ruler or leader.</p>

<p>Whatever value this book has is the reflection of
personal observation and the thoughts which have occurred
to me when I have walked around my experiences
and measured them and found what was worth
while and what was not. Such as they are, they are
real.</p>

<p>Most vital of all in sheer expression of military
power was the visit to the British Grand Fleet; most
humanly appealing, the time spent in Belgium under
German rule; most dramatic, the French victory on
the Marne; most precious, my long stay at the British
front.</p>

<p>A traveller’s view I had of Germany in the early
period of the war; but I was never with the German
army which made Americans particularly welcome for
obvious reasons. Between right and wrong one cannot
be a neutral. By foregoing the diversion of shaking
hands and passing the time of day on the Germanic
fronts, I escaped having to be agreeable to hosts warring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
for a cause and in a manner obnoxious to me. I
was among friends, living the life of one army and
seeing war in all its aspects from day to day, instead
of having tourist glimpses.</p>

<p>Chapters which deal with the British army in
France and with the British fleet have been submitted
to the censor. In all, possibly one typewritten page
fell foul of the blue pencil. Though the censor may
delete military secrets, he may not prompt opinions.
Whatever notes of praise and of affection which you
may read between the lines or in them spring from
the mind and heart. Undemonstratively, cheerily as
they would go for a walk, with something of old-fashioned
chivalry, the British went to death.</p>

<p>Their national weaknesses and strength, revealed
under external differences by association, are more
akin to ours than we shall realise until we face our own
inevitable crisis. Though one’s ancestors had been in
America for nearly three centuries and had fought
the British twice for a good cause he was continually
finding how much of custom, of law, of habit, and of
instinct he had in common with them; and how Americans
who were not of British blood also shared these
as an applied inheritance that has been the most formative
element in the crucible of the races which has produced
the American type.</p>

<p>My grateful acknowledgments are due to the
American press associations who considered me
worthy to be the accredited American correspondent
at the British front, and to <cite>Collier’s</cite> and <cite>Everybody’s</cite>;
and may an author who has not had the opportunity
to read proofs request the reader’s indulgence.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The ultimate arbitrament&mdash;The diplomatist’s status&mdash;The causes
in the aims and ideals of the peoples&mdash;Europe’s economic relation
to the rest of the world&mdash;The economic cause&mdash;“Biological
necessity”&mdash;England’s position&mdash;Her complacency&mdash;The “German
Wedge”&mdash;The German system&mdash;Modern efficiency methods&mdash;“A
machine civil world”&mdash;The Kaiser’s mission&mdash;A
German the world over&mdash;Germany’s plans and ambitions&mdash;Her
war spirit&mdash;Activities in Italy&mdash;The Austrian situation&mdash;The
Slav-Teuton racial hatred&mdash;France, a nation with a closed-in
culture&mdash;The Kaiser’s “peace”&mdash;The Germanic “isolation.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Who started it? Who is to blame? The courts
decide the point when there is a quarrel between
Smith and Jones; and it is the ethics of simple justice
that no friend of Smith or Jones should act as
judge. When the quarrel is between nations, the
neutral world turns to the diplomatic correspondence
which preceded the breaking-off of relations; and only
one who is a neutral can hope to weigh impartially
the evidence on both sides. For war is the highest
degree of partisanship. Every one engaged is a special
pleader.</p>

<p>I, too, have read the White and Blue and Yellow
and Green Papers. Others have analysed them in
detail; I shall not attempt it. One learned less from
their dignified phraseology than from the human motives
that he read between the lines. Each was aiming
to make out the best case for its own side; aiming
to put the heart of justice into the blows of its arms.
Obviously, the diplomatist is an attorney for a client.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
Incidentally, the whole training of his profession is
to try to prevent war. He does try to prevent it;
so does every right-minded man. It is a horror and
a scourge, to be avoided as you would avoid leprosy.
When it does come, the diplomatist’s business is to
place all the blame for it with the enemy.</p>

<p>One must go many years back of the dates of the
State papers to find the cause of the Great War. He
must go into the hearts of the people who are fighting,
into their aims and ambitions, which diplomatists
make plausible according to international law. More
illumining than the pamphlets embracing an exchange
of despatches was the remark of a practical German:
“Von Bethmann-Hollweg made a slip when he talked
of a treaty as a scrap of paper and about hacking his
way through. That had a bad effect.”</p>

<p>Equally pointed was the remark of a practical
Briton: “It was a good thing that the Germans violated
the neutrality of Belgium; otherwise, we might
not have gone in, which would have been fatal for us.
If Germany had crushed France and kept the Channel
ports, the next step would have been a war in
which we should have had to deal with her single-handed.”</p>

<p>I would rather catch the drift of a nation’s purpose
from the talk of statesmen in the lobby or in the club
than from their official pronouncements. Von Bethmann-Hollweg
had said in public what was universally
accepted in private. He had let the cat out of the
bag. England’s desire to preserve the neutrality of
Belgium was not altogether ethical. If Belgium’s
coast had been on the Adriatic rather than on the
British Channel, her wrongs would not have had the
support of British arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
Great moral causes were at stake in the Great
War; but they are inextricably mixed with cool, national
self-interest and racial hatreds, which are also
dictated by self-interest, though not always by the
interests of the human race. One who sees the struggle
of Europe as a spectator, with no hatred in his
heart except of war itself, finds prejudice and
efficiency, folly and merciless logic, running in company.
He would return to the simplest principles,
human principles, to avoid confusion in his own mind.
Not of Europe, he studies Europe; he wonders at
Europe.</p>

<p>On a map of the world twice the size of a foolscap
page, the little finger’s end will cover the area of the
struggle. Europe is a very small section of the earth’s
surface, indeed. Yet at the thought of a great
European war, all the other peoples drew their breath
aghast. When the catastrophe came, all were affected
in their most intimate relations, in their income,
and in their intellectual life. Rare was the mortal
who did not find himself taking sides in what would
have seemed to an astronomer on Mars as a local terrestrial
upheaval.</p>

<p>From Europe have gone forth the waves of vigour
and enterprise which have had the greatest influence
on the rest of the world, in much the same way that
they went forth from Rome over the then known
world. The war in this respect was like the great
Roman civil war. The dominating power of our civilisation
was at war with itself. Draw a circle around
England, Scandinavia, the Germanic countries, and
France, and you have the hub from which the spokes
radiate to the immense wheel-rim. It is a region
which cannot feed its mouths from its own soil, though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
it could amply a little more than a century ago in the
Napoleonic struggle. In a sense, then, it is a physical
parasite on the rest of the world; a parasite which,
however, has given its intellectual energy in return for
food for its body.</p>

<p>This war had for its object the delivery of no people
from bondage, except the Belgians after the war had
begun; it had no religious purpose such as the Crusades;
it was not the uprising of democracy like the
French Revolution. Those who charged the machine
guns and the wives and mothers who urged them on
were unconscious of the real force disguised by their
patriotic fervour. Ask a man to die for money and he
refuses. Ask him to die in order that he may have
more butter on his bread and he refuses. This is putting
the cause of war too bluntly. It is insulting to
courage and to self-sacrifice, assessing them as something
set on a counter for sale. For nations do not
know why they fight, as a rule. Processes of evolution
and chains of events arouse their patriotic ardour and
their martial instinct till the climax comes in blows.</p>

<p>The cause of the European war is economic; and, by
the same token, Europe kept the peace for forty years
for economic reasons. She was busy skimming the
cream of the resources of other countries. Hers was
the capital, the skill, the energy, the <em>morale</em>, the culture,
for exploiting the others. All modern invention
originated with her or with the offspring of her races
beyond seas. Steamers brought her raw material,
which she sent back in manufactures; they took forth,
in place of the buccaneers of former days seeking gold,
her financiers, engineers, salesmen, and teachers, who
returned with tribute or sent back the interest on the
capital they had applied to enterprise. She looked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
down on the rest of the world with something of the
Roman patrician feeling of superiority to outsiders.</p>

<p>But also the medical scientist kept pace with other
scientists and with invention. Sanitation and the
preservation of life led to an amazing rapidity of increase
in population. There were more mouths to
feed and more people who must have work and share
the tribute. Without the increase of population it is
possible that we should not have had war. Biological
necessity played its part in bringing on the struggle,
along with economic pressure. The richest veins of
the mines of other lands, the most accessible wood of
the forests, were taken, and a higher rate of living all
over Europe increased the demand of the numbers.</p>

<p>Most fortunate of all the European peoples were
the British. Most significant in this material progress
was the part of Germany. England had a narrow
stretch of salt water between her and the other nations.
They could fight one another by crossing a land frontier;
to fight her, they must cross in ships. She had
the advantage of being of Europe and yet separated
from Europe. All the seas were the secure pathway
for her trade, guaranteed for a century by the victory
of Trafalgar. By war she had won her sea power;
by war she was the mistress of many colonies. Germany’s
increasing mercantile marine had to travel
from a narrow sea front through the channel called
British. Rich was England’s heritage beyond her own
realisation. Hers the accumulated capital; hers the
field of resources under her own flag to exploit.</p>

<p>But she had done more. Through a century’s experience
she had learned the strength of moderation.
What she had won by war she was holding by wisdom.
If some one must guard the seas, if some one must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
have dominion over brown and yellow races, she was
well fitted for the task. Wherever she had dominion,
whether Bombay or Hongkong, there was freedom in
trade and in development for all men. We who have
travelled recognise this.</p>

<p>When the war began, South Africa had no British
regular garrisons, but the Boers, a people who had lost
their nation in war with her fifteen years before, took
up arms under her flag to invade a German colony.
India without a parliament, India ruled by English
governors, sent her troops to fight in France. In place
of sedition, loyalty from a brave and hardy white
people of another race and from hundreds of millions
of brown men! Such power is not gained by war, but
by the policy of fair play; of live and let live. Measurably,
she held in trust those distant lands for the
other progressive nations; she was the policeman of
wide domains. Certainly no neutral, at least no
American, envied her the task. Certainly no neutral,
for selfish reasons if for no other, would want to risk
chaos throughout the world by the transfer of that
power to another nation.</p>

<p>England was satiated, as Admiral Mahan said.
She had gained all that she cared to hold. It is not too
much to say that, of late years, colonies might come
begging to her doorstep and be refused. Those who
held her wealth were complacent as well as satiated&mdash;which
was her danger. For complacency goes with
satiation. But she, too, was suffering from having
skimmed the cream, for want of mines and concessions
as rich as those which had filled her coffers, and from
the demand of the increased population become used
to a higher rate of living. Her vast, accumulated
wealth in investments the world over was in relatively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
few hands. In no great European country, perhaps,
was wealth more unevenly distributed. Her old age
pensions and many social reforms of recent years arose
from a restlessness, locally intensified but not alone of
local origin.</p>

<p>Another flag was appearing too frequently in her
channel. A wedge was being forced into her complacency.
A competitor who worked twelve hours a
day, while complacency preferred eight or ten, met the
Englishman at every turn. A navy was growing in the
Baltic; taxes pressed heavily on complacency to keep up
a navy stronger than the young rival’s. Who really
was to blame for the clerks’ pay being kept down, while
the cost of living went up? That cheap-living German
clerk! What capitalist was pressing the English capitalist?
The German! The newspapers were always
hinting at the German danger. Certain interests in
England, as in any other country, were glad to find a
scapegoat. Why should Germany want colonies when
England ruled her colonies so well? Germany&mdash;always
Germany, whatever way you looked, Germany
with her seventy millions, aggressive, enterprising, industrious,
organised! The pressure of the wedge kept
increasing. Something must break.</p>

<p>Does any one doubt that if Germany had been in
England’s place she would have struck the rival in the
egg? But that is not the way of complacency. Nor
is it the way of that wisdom of moderation, that live
and let live, which has kept the British Empire intact.</p>

<p>Germany wanted room for her wedge. In Central
Europe, with foes on either side, she had to hold two
land frontiers before she could start her sea wedge.
She was the more readily convinced that England had
won all she held by war because modern Germany was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
the product of war. By war Prussia won Schleswig-Holstein;
by war Germany won Alsace-Lorraine, and
welded the Germanic peoples into a whole. It was
only natural that the German public should be loyal to
the system that had fathered German success.</p>

<p>Thus, England reveres its Wellingtons, Nelsons,
Pitts, and maintains the traditions of the regiments
which fought for her. Thus, we are loyal to the Constitution
of the United States, because it was drafted
by the forefathers who made the nation. If it had
been drafted in the thirties we should think it more
fallible. It is the nature of individuals, of business
concerns, of nations, to hold with the methods that laid
the foundations of success till some cataclysm shows
that they are wrong or antiquated. This reckoning
may be sudden loss of his position in a crisis for the
individual, bankruptcy for the business concern, war
for the nation. One sticks to the doctor who cured
him when he was young and perhaps goes to an early
grave because that doctor has grown out of date.</p>

<p>The old Kaiser, Bismarck, and von Moltke laid the
basis of the German system. It was industry, unity,
and obedience to superiors, from bottom to top. Under
it, if not because of it, Germany became a mighty
national entity. Another Kaiser, who had the merit of
making the most of his inheritance, with other generals
and leaders, brought modern methods to the service of
the successful system. A new, up-to-date doctor succeeded
the old, with the inherited authority of the old.</p>

<p>That aristocratic, exclusive German officer, staring
at you, elbowing you if you did not give him right of
way in the street, seemed to express insufferable caste
to the outsider. But he was a part of the system which
had won; and he worked longer hours than the officers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
of other European armies. Seeming to enjoy enormous
privileges, he was really a circumscribed being,
subject to all the rigid discipline that he demanded of
others, bred and fashioned for war. Wherever I
have met foreign military attachés observing other
wars, the German was the busiest one, the most persistent
and resourceful after information; and he was
not acting on his own initiative, but under careful
instructions of a staff who knew exactly what it wanted
to know. “Germany shall be first!” was his motto;
“Germany shall be first!” the motto of all Germans.</p>

<p>In the same way that von Moltke constructed his
machine army, the Germany of the young Kaiser set
out to construct a machine civil world. He had a
public which was ready to be moulded, because plasticity
to the master’s hand had beaten France. Drill,
application, and discipline had done the trick for von
Moltke&mdash;these and leadership. The new method
was economic education plus drill, application, and
discipline.</p>

<p>It is not for me to describe the industrial beehive of
modern Germany. The world knows it well. The
Kaiser, who led, worked as hard as the humblest of his
subjects. From the top came the impetus which the
leaders passed on. Germany looked for worlds to
conquer; England had conquered hers. The energy
of increasing population overflowed from the boundaries,
pushing that wedge closer home to an England
growing more irritably apprehensive.</p>

<p>Wherever the traveller went he found Germans,
whether waiters, or capitalists, or salesmen, learning
the language of the country where they lived, making
place for themselves by their industry. Germany was
struggling for room, and the birth rate was increasing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
the excess of population. The business of German
nationalism was to keep them all in Germany and
mould them into so much more power behind the sea
wedge. The German teaching&mdash;that teaching of a
partisan youth which is never complacent&mdash;did not
contemplate a world composed of human beings, but a
world composed of Germans, loyal to the Kaiser, and
others who were not. Within that tiny plot on the
earth’s surface the German system was giving more
people a livelihood and more comforts for their resources
than anywhere else, unless in Belgium.</p>

<p>Germany and her Kaiser believed that she had a
mission and the right to more room. Wherever there
was an opportunity she appeared with his aggressive
paternalism to get ground for Germanic seed. The
experience of her opportunistic fishing in the troubled
waters of Manila Bay in ’98 is still fresh in the
minds of many Americans. She went into China during
the Boxer rebellion in the same spirit. She had
her foot thrust into every doorway ajar and was pushing
with all her organised imperial might, which kept
growing.</p>

<p>I never think of modern Germany without calling to
mind two Germans who seem to me to illustrate German
strength&mdash;and weakness. In a compartment
on a train from Berlin to Holland some years ago, an
Englishman was saying that Germany was a balloon
which would burst. He called the Kaiser a vain madman
and set his free English tongue on his dislike of
Prussian boorishness, aggressiveness, and <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">verbotens</i>.
I told him that I should never choose to live in Prussia;
I preferred England or France; but I thought that England
was closing her eyes to Germany’s development.
The Kaiser seemed to me a very clever man, his people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
on the whole loyal to him; while it was wonderful
how so great a population had been organised and
cared for. We might learn the value of co-ordination
from Germany, without adopting militarism or other
characteristics which we disliked.</p>

<p>The Englishman thought that I was pro-German.
For in Europe one must always be pro or anti something;
Francophile or Francophobe, Germanophile or
Germanophobe. I noticed the train-guard listening at
intervals to our discussion. Perhaps he knew English.
Many German train-guards do. Few English or
French train-guards know any but their own language.
This also is suggestive, if you care to take it that way.</p>

<p>When I left the train, the guard, instead of a porter,
took my bag to the custom house. Probably he was
of a mind to add to his income, I thought. After I
was through the customs he put my bag in a compartment
of the Dutch train. When I offered him a tip,
the manner of his refusal made me feel rather mean.
He saluted and clicked his heels together and said:
“Thank you, sir, for what you said about my Emperor!”
and with a military step marched back to the
German train. How he had boiled inwardly as he
listened to the Englishman and held his temper, thinking
that “the day” was coming!</p>

<p>The second German was first mate of a little German
steamer on the Central American coast. The
mark of German thoroughness was on him. He spoke
English and Spanish well; he was highly efficient, so
far as I could tell. After passing through the Straits
of Magellan, the steamer went as far as Vancouver in
British Columbia. Its traffic was the small kind which
the English did not find worth while, but which tireless
German capability in details and cheap labour made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
profitable. The steamer stopped at every small West,
South, and Central American and Mexican port to take
on and leave cargo. At any hour of the night anchor
was dropped, perhaps in a heavy ground-swell and
almost invariably in intense tropical heat. Sometimes
a German coffee planter came on board and had a glass
of beer with the captain and the mate. For nearly all
the rich Guatemala coffee estates had passed into German
hands. The Guatemaltecan dictator taxed the
native owners bankrupt and the Germans, in collusion
with him, bought in the estates.</p>

<p>Life for that mate was a battle with filthy <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">cargadores</i>
in stifling heat; he snatched his sleep when he
might between ports. The steamer was in Hamburg
to dock and refit once a year. Then he saw his wife
and children for at most a month; sometimes for only
a week. In any essay-contest on “Is Life Worth Living?”
it seemed to me he ought to win the prize for
the negative side.</p>

<p>“Since I have been on this run I have seen California
ranches,” he said. “If I had come out to California
fifteen years ago, when I thought of emigrating
to America, by working half as hard as I have
worked&mdash;and that would be harder than most California
ranchers work&mdash;I could have had my own plot
of ground and my own house and lived at home with
my family. But when I spoke of emigrating I was
warned against it. Maybe you don’t know that the
local officials have orders to dissuade intending emigrants
from their purpose. They told me that the
United States and Canada were lands of graft, injustice,
and disorder, where native Americans formed a
caste which kept all immigrants at manual labour. I
should be robbed and forced to work for the trusts for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
a pittance. Instead of an imperial government to
protect me, I should be exploited by millionaire kings.
Wasn’t I a German? Wasn’t I loyal to my Kaiser?
Would I forfeit my nationality? This appeal decided
me. And I am too old, now, to start at ranching.”</p>

<p>Had I been one of those wicked millionaire kings
of the United States or Canada, I should have set this
man up on a ranch, believing that he was not yet too
old to make good in a new land if he were given a
fair start, knowing that he would pay back the capital
with interest; and I have known wicked millionaire
kings to be guilty of such lapses as this from their
tyranny.</p>

<p>The imperial German system wanted his earning
power and energy back of the sea wedge. German
steamship companies promoted emigration from Hungary,
Russia, and Italy for the fares it brought. The
German government, however, took care that the
steamship companies carried no German emigrants;
and it ruled that no Russian peasant or Polish Jew
bound for Hamburg or Bremen on the way to America
might stop over <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en route</i> across Germany, lest he stay.
Russians and Poles and Jews were not desirable material
for the German sea wedge. Let them go into
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pot-au-feu</i> of the capacious and indiscriminating
American melting-pot, which may yet make something
of them that will surprise the chauvinists.</p>

<p>Breed more Germans; keep them fed, clothed, employed,
organised industrially, educated! Don’t relieve
the economic pressure by emigration or by lowering
the birth rate! Keep up the military spirit! Develop
the money spirit! Instilled with loyalty to the
Kaiser, with a sense of superiority in industry and
training as well as of racial superiority, the German<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
felt himself the victim of a world injustice. He saw
complacent England living on the fat of empire. He
saw America with its rich resources and lack of civil
organisation and discipline and its waste individual
effort.</p>

<p>If the United States only would not play the dog in
the manger! If Germany could apply the magic of
her system to Mexico or Central America, what tribute
that would bring home to Berlin! Consider organised
German industrialism working India for all that
it was worth! Or Zanzibar! Or the Straits Settlements!
Germany had the restless ambition, with an
undercurrent of resentment, of the young manager
with modern methods who wants to supplant the old
manager and his old-fogy methods&mdash;an old manager
set in his way, but a very kindly, sound old manager,
to whose ways the world had grown accustomed.</p>

<p>Taxes for armament, and particularly for that new
navy, lay heavily on Germany, too. Driving the
wedge by peaceful means became increasingly difficult.
It needed the blow of war to split open the way to rich
fields. The war spirit lost nothing by Germany’s
sense of isolation. For this isolation England was to
blame; she and the alliances which King Edward had
formed around her. England was to blame for everything.
Germany could not be to blame for anything.
The national rival is always the scapegoat of patriotism.
So Germany prepared to strike, as one prepares
to build and open a store or to put on a play.</p>

<p>Where forty years ago the Englishman, with his
aggressive ways, was the unpopular traveller in
Europe, the German had become most disliked. In
Italy, with his expanding industry, he ran many hotels.
His success and his personal manners combined to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
make the sensitive Italian loathe him. Thus, he
sowed the seed of popular feeling which broke in a
wave that forced Italy into the war.</p>

<p>Germany thought of England as too selfish and cunning
in her complacency really to come to the aid of
France and Russia. She would stay out; and had she
stayed out, Germany would have crushed Russia and
then turned on France. But Germany did not know
England any better than England knew Germany.
The jaundiced mists of chauvinism kept even high leaders
from seeing their adversaries clearly.</p>

<p>Austria, too, was feeling economic pressure. Her
people, especially the Hungarians, looked toward the
southeast for expansion. Her shrewd statesmanship,
its instincts inherited from the Hapsburg dynasty,
playing race hatred against race hatred and bound, so
it looked, to national disruption, welcomed any opportunity
which would set the mind of the whole people
thinking of some exterior object rather than of internal
differences. She annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina with
its Slav population at a moment when Russia was not
prepared to aid her kindred. Bosnia and Herzegovina
are better off for the annexation; they have
enjoyed rapid material progress as the result.</p>

<p>Bounded by the Danube and the Turk were the
Balkan countries, which ought to be the garden spot of
civilisation. Here, poverty aggravated racial hate
and racial hate aggravated poverty in a vicious circle.
Serbia, longest free of the Turk, adjoining Austria,
had no outlet except through other lands. She was a
commercial slave of Austria, dependent on Austrian
tariffs and Austrian railroads, with Hungarian business
men holding the purse-strings of trade. In her swineherds
and tillers the desire for some of the good things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
of modern life was developing. Strangling, with
Austria’s hands at her throat, with many clever, resourceful
agitators urging her on, she fought in the
only way that she knew. To Austria she was the uncouth
swineherd who assassinated the Austrian Crown
Prince and his consort. This deed was the exterior
object which united Austria in a passionate rage. For
Austria, more than any other country, could welcome
war for the old reason. It let out the emotion of the
nation against an enemy instead of against its own
rulers.</p>

<p>A deeper-seated cause was the racial hatred of Slav
and Teuton. For rulers do not make war these days;
they try to keep their thrones secure on the crest of
public opinion. They appear to rule and to give, and
are ruled and yield. Whoever had travelled in Russia
of late years had been conscious of a rising ground-swell
in the great mass of Russian feeling. Your simple
<i xml:lang="ru" lang="ru">moujik</i> had an idea that his Czar had yielded to the
Austrians and the Germans. In short, the German
had tweaked the nose of the Slav race with the annexation
of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Czar had borne
the insult because his people were willing.</p>

<p>Slow to think, and not thinking overmuch, the Russian
peasant began to see red whenever he thought of
a German. As a whole public thinks, eventually its
rulers must think. The upper class of Russia was inclined
to fan the flames of the people’s passions. If
the people were venting their emotions against the
Teuton they would not be developing further revolutions
against the old order of things. The military
class was prompt to make use of the national tendency
to strengthen military resources. By action and reaction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
across the frontiers the strain was increasing.
Germany saw Russia with double her own population
and was sensitive to the dangers behind Russia’s ambitions.
Russia stood for everything abhorrent to
German order and racial feeling.</p>

<p>And what of France? There is little to say of her
when we assign responsibility. Here was a nation
with its population practically stationary; a nation with
a closed-in culture; a democracy with its racial and national
integrity assured by its own peculiar genius.
Visions of conquest had passed from the French mind.
Her “place in the sun” was her own sun of France.
Her trade was that due to skill in handicraft rather
than to any tactics of aggression. At every Hague
conference France was for all measures that would
assure peace; Germany against every one that might
interfere with her military ambition; England against
any that might limit her action in defending the seas.</p>

<p>The desire for “revenge” for ’70 had died out in
the younger generation of Frenchmen. Her stationary
population, which chauvinists resented, had solved
the problem of expansion. From father to son, she
could be content with her thrift, her industry, and her
arts, and with the joy of living. For, more than any
other European nation, she had that gift: the joy of
living. Her armies and her alliances were truly for
defence. She could not fight Germany and Austria
alone. She must have help. If Russia went to war
she, too, must go to war. She acted up to her belief
when she held back her armies five miles from the
frontier till the German struck; when she gave Germany
a start in mobilisation&mdash;a start which, with
England’s delay, came near being fatal for her. That<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
price she paid for peace; that advantage Germany
gained by striking first. It is a hard moral for the
pacificists, but one which ought to give the French conscience
a cleaner taste in after years.</p>

<p>The Kaiser, too, insisted that he was for peace. So
he was, according to German logic. He realised his
military power as the outside world could not realise
it. Had Italy joined her forces to her allies, he might
have crushed France and then turned on Russia, as
his staff had planned. For striking he could reduce
France to a second-rate power, take her colonies, fatten
German coffers with an enormous indemnity, and gain
Belgium and the Channel ports as the next step in national
ambition before crushing England and securing
the mastery of the seas. But he held off the blow for
many years; that is the logic of his partisanship for
peace. The fact that France proved stronger than he
thought hardly interfered with his belief in his own
moderation, in view of his confidence in his arms before
the test came. He was for peace because he did
not knock the other man down as soon as he might.</p>

<p>No other race in all Europe liked the Germans; not
even the Huns, or the Czechs, or the Croats, and least
of all the Italians. The Belgians, too, shared the universal
enmity. It was Germany that Belgium feared.
Her forts looked toward Germany; she looked toward
England and France for protection. In this she was
unneutral; but not in the thing that counted&mdash;thorough
military preparation.</p>

<p>Thus were the Germanic empires isolated in sentiment
before the war began. This strengthened their
realisation that their one true ally was their power in
arms, unaffected by any sentiment except that of beating
their enemies. Europe, straining under the taxation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
of preparation, long held back by fear of the
cataclysm, yet drawn by curiosity as to the nature of its
capacity, sent her millions of soldiers to that test in
practice of the struggle of modern arms which had
been the haunting subject of her speculation.</p>

<span class="subhead">“LE BRAVE BELGE!”</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The stampede to Europe&mdash;Early days in Belgium&mdash;Characteristics
of the Allies’ armies&mdash;Rumours&mdash;First skirmishes&mdash;When
would the English come?&mdash;<i xml:lang="be" lang="be">Shipperke</i> spirit&mdash;Pathos of the Belgian
defence&mdash;A Taube and a Belgian cyclist patrol&mdash;Brussels
before its fall&mdash;A momentous decision.</p></blockquote>

<p>The rush from Monterey, in Mexico, when a telegram
said that general European war was inevitable; the
run and jump aboard the <i>Lusitania</i> at New York the
night that war was declared by England against Germany;
the Atlantic passage on the liner of ineffaceable
memory, a suspense broken by fragments of war news
by wireless; the arrival in an England before the war
was a week old; the journey to Belgium in the hope of
reaching the scene of action!&mdash;as I write, all seem to
have the perspective of history, so final are the processes
of war, so swift their execution, and so eager
is every one for each day’s developments. As one
grows older the years seem shorter; but the first year
of the Great War is the longest year I have known.</p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Le brave Belge!</i> One must be honest about him.
If one lets his heart run away with his judgment he
does his mind an injustice. A fellow-countryman who
was in London and fresh from home in the eighth
month of the war, asked me for my views of the relative
efficiency of the different armies engaged.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that I am to speak without regard to
personal sympathies?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” he replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
When he had my opinion he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“You have mentioned them all except the Belgian
army. I thought it was the bravest and best of all.”</p>

<p>“Is that what they think at home?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>

<p>“The Atlantic is broad,” I suggested.</p>

<p>This man of affairs, an exponent of the efficiency of
business, was a sentimentalist when it came to war,
as Anglo-Saxons usually are. The side which they
favour&mdash;that is the efficient side. When I ventured
to suggest that the Belgian army, in a professional
sense, was hardly to be considered as an army, it was
clear that he had ceased to associate my experience
with any real knowledge.</p>

<p>In business he was one who saw his rivals, their abilities,
the organisation of their concerns, and their resources
of competition with a clear eye. He could say
of his best personal friend: “I like him, but he has a
poor head for affairs.” Yet he was the type who, if
he had been a trained soldier, would have been a business
man of war, who would have wanted a sharp,
ready sword in a well-trained hand and to leave nothing
to chance in a battle for the right. In Germany,
where some of the best brains of the country are
given to making war a business, he might have been a
soldier who would rise to a position on the staff. In
America he was the employer of three thousand men&mdash;a
general of civil life.</p>

<p>“But look how the Belgians have fought!” he exclaimed.
“They stopped the whole German army for
two weeks.”</p>

<p>The best army was best because it had his sympathy.
His view was the popular view in America: the view
of the heart. America saw the pigmy fighting the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
giant rather than let him pass over Belgian soil. On
that day when a gallant young king cried, “To arms!”
all his people became gallant to the imagination.</p>

<p>When I think of Belgium’s part in the war I always
think of the little Belgian dog, the <i xml:lang="be" lang="be">shipperke</i>, who lives
on the canal boats. He is a home-staying dog, loyal,
affectionate, domestic, who never goes out on the tow-path
to pick quarrels with other dogs; but let anything
on two or four feet try to go on board when his master
is away and he will fight with every ounce of
strength in him. The King had the <i xml:lang="be" lang="be">shipperke</i> spirit.
All the Belgians who had the <i xml:lang="be" lang="be">shipperke</i> spirit tried to
sink their teeth in the calves of the invader.</p>

<p>One’s heart was with the Belgians on that eighteenth
day of August, 1914, when one set out toward
the front in an automobile from a Brussels rejoicing
over bulletins of victory, its streets walled with bunting;
but there was something brewing in one’s mind
which was as treason to one’s desires. Let Brussels
enjoy its flags and its capture of German cavalry
patrols while it might!</p>

<p>On the hills back of Louvain we came upon some
Belgian troops in their long, cumbersome coats, dark
silhouettes against the field, digging shallow trenches
in an uncertain sort of way. Whether it was them or
the Belgian staff officers hurrying by in their cars, I
had the impression of the will and not the way and a
parallel of raw militia in uniforms taken from grandfather’s
trunk facing the trained antagonists of an
Austerlitz, or a Waterloo, or a Gettysburg.</p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Le brave Belge!</i> The question on that day was
not, Are you brave? but, Do you know how to fight?
Also, Would the French and the British arrive in time
to help you? Of a thousand rumours about the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
positions of the French and the British armies, one was
as good as another. All the observer knew was that
he was an atom in a motor and all he saw for the
defence of Belgium was a regiment of Belgians digging
trenches. He need not have been in Belgium
before to realise that here were an unwarlike people,
living by intensive thrift and caution&mdash;a most domesticated
civilisation in the most thickly populated workshop
in Europe, counting every blade of grass and
every kernel of wheat and making its pleasures go a
long way at small cost; a hothouse of a land, with the
door about to be opened to the withering blast of war.</p>

<p>Out of the Hôtel de Ville at Louvain, as our car
halted by the cathedral door, came an elderly French
officer, walking with a light, quick step, his cloak
thrown back over his shoulders, and hurriedly entered
a car; and after him came a tall British officer, walking
more slowly, imperturbably, as a man who meant to
let nothing disturb him or beat him&mdash;both characteristic
types of race. This was the break-up of the last
military conference held at Louvain, which had now
ceased to be Belgian Headquarters.</p>

<p>How little you knew and how much they knew!
The sight of them was helpful. One was the representative
of a force of millions of Frenchmen; of the
army. I had always believed in the French army, and
have more reason now than ever before to believe in it.
There was no doubt that if a French corps and a German
corps were set the task of marching a hundred
miles to a strategic position, the French would arrive
first and win the day in a pitched battle. But no one
knew this better than that German staff whose superiority,
as von Moltke said, would always ensure
victory. Was the French army ready? Could it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
bring fulness of its strength into the first and perhaps
the deciding shock of arms? Where was the French
army?</p>

<p>The other officer who came out of the Hôtel de
Ville was the representative of a little army&mdash;a handful
of regulars&mdash;hard as nails and ready to the last
button. Where was the British army? The restaurant
keeper where we had luncheon at Louvain&mdash;he
knew. He whispered his military secret to me. The
British army was toward Antwerp, waiting to crush
the Germans in the flank should they advance on
Brussels. We were “drawing them on!” Most
cheerful, most confident, mine host! When I went
back to Louvain under German rule his restaurant was
in ruins.</p>

<p>We were on our way to as near the front as we
would go, with a pass which was written for us by a
Belgian reservist in Brussels between sips of beer
brought him by a boy scout. It was a unique, a most
accommodating, pass; the only one I have received
from the Allies’ side which would have taken me into
the German lines.</p>

<p>The front which we saw was in the square of the
little town of Haelen, where some dogs of a dog machine
gun battery lay panting in their traces. A
Belgian officer in command there I recollect for his
passionate repetition of, “Assassins! The barbarians!”
which seemed to choke out any other words
whenever he spoke of the Germans. His was a fresh,
livid hate, born of recent fighting. We could go
where we pleased, he said; and the Germans were
“out there,” not far away. Very tired he was, except
for the flash of hate in his eyes; as tired as the
dogs of the mitrailleuse battery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
We went outside to see the scene of “the battle,”
as it was called in the despatches; a field in the first
flush of the war, where the headless lances of Belgian
and German cavalrymen were still scattered about.
The peasants had broken off the lance-heads for the
steel, which was something to pay for the grain smouldering
in the barn which had been shelled and burned.</p>

<p>A battle! It was a battle because the reporters
could get some account of it and the fighting in Alsace
was hidden under the cloud of secrecy. A superficial
survey was enough to show that it had been only a
reconnaissance by the Germans with some infantry and
guns as well as cavalry. Their defeat had been an incident
to the thrust of a tiny feeling finger of the German
octopus for information. The scouting of the
German cavalry patrols here and there had the same
object. Waiting behind hedges or sweeping around
in the rear of a patrol with their own cavalry when
the word came by telephone, the Belgians bagged many
a German, man and horse, dead and alive.</p>

<p>Brussels and London and New York, too, thrilled
over these exploits supplied to eager readers. It was
the Uhlan week of the war; for every German cavalryman
was an Uhlan, according to popular conception.
These Uhlans seemed to have more temerity than
sense from the accounts that one read. But if one
out of a dozen of these mounted youth, with horses
fresh and a trooper’s zest in the first flush of war, returned
to say that he had ridden to such and such
points without finding any signs of British or French
forces, he had paid for the loss of the others. The
Germans had plenty of cavalry. They used it as the
eyes of the army, in co-operation with the aerial eyes
of the planes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
A peasant woman came out of the house beside the
battlefield with her children around her; a flat-chested,
thin woman, prematurely old with toil. “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Les Anglais!</i>”
she cried at sight of us. Seeing that we had
some lances in the car, she rushed into her house and
brought out half a dozen more. If the English
wanted lances they should have them. She knew only
a few words of French, not enough to express the
question which she made understood by gestures. Her
eyes were burning with appeal to us and flashing with
hate as she shook her fist toward the Germans.</p>

<p>When were the English coming? All her trust was
in the English, the invincible English, to save her
country. Probably the average European would have
passed her by as an excited peasant woman. But
pitiful she was to me, more pitiful than the raging
officer and his dog battery, or the infantry awkwardly
entrenching back of Louvain, or flag-decked Brussels
believing in victory: one of the Belgians with the true
<i xml:lang="be" lang="be">shipperke</i> spirit. She was shaking her fist at a dam
which was about to burst in a flood.</p>

<p>It was strange to an American, who comes from a
land where every one learns a single language, English,
that she and her ancestors, through centuries of
living neighbour in a thickly-populated country to people
who speak French and to French civilisation,
should never have learned to express themselves in
any but their own tongue&mdash;singular, almost incredible,
tenacity in the age of popular education! She
would save the lance heads and garner every grain of
wheat; she economised in all but racial animosity.
This racial stubbornness of Europe&mdash;perhaps it keeps
Europe powerful in jealous competition of race with
race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
The thought that went home was that she did not
want the Germans to come; no Belgian wanted them;
and this was the fact decisive in the scales of justice.
She said, as the officer had said, that the Germans
were “out there.” Across the fields one saw nothing
on that still August day; no sign of war unless a
Taube overhead, the first enemy aeroplane I had seen
in war. For the last two days the German patrols
had ceased to come. Liége, we knew, had fallen.
Looking at the map, we prayed that Namur would
hold.</p>

<p>“Out there” beyond the quiet fields that mighty
force which was to swing through Belgium in flank
was massed and ready to move when the German staff
opened the throttle. A mile or so away a patrol of
Belgian cyclists stopped us as we turned toward Brussels.
They were dust-covered and weary; the voice
of their captain was faint with fatigue. For over two
weeks he had been on the hunt of Uhlan patrols. Another
<i xml:lang="be" lang="be">shipperke</i> he, who could not only hate but fight
as best he knew how.</p>

<p>“We had an alarm,” he said. “Have you heard
anything?”</p>

<p>When we told him no, he pedalled on more slowly,
and oh, how wearily! to the front. Rather pitiful
that, too, when you thought of what was “out there.”</p>

<p>One had learned enough to know, without the confidential
information that he received, that the Germans
could take Brussels if they chose. But the people
of Brussels still thronged the streets under the
blankets of bunting. If bunting could save Brussels,
it was in no danger.</p>

<p>There was a mockery about my dinner that night.
The waiter who laid the white cloth on a marble table<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
was unctuously suggestive as to menu. Luscious grapes
and crisp salad, which Belgian gardeners grow with
meticulous care, I remember of it. One might linger
over his coffee, knowing the truth, and look out at the
people who did not know it. When they were not
buying more buttons with the allied colours, or more
flags, or dropping nickel pieces in Red Cross boxes,
they were thronging to the kiosks for the latest edition
of the evening papers, which told them nothing.</p>

<p>And one had to make up his mind. Clearly, he had
only to keep in his room in his hotel in order to have
a great experience. He might see the German troops
enter Belgium. His American passport would protect
him as a neutral; Minister Brand Whitlock and
Secretary of Legation Hugh Gibson would get him
out of trouble.</p>

<p>“Stick to the army you are with!” an eminent
American had told me.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I prefer to choose my army,” I had replied.</p>

<p>The army I chose was not about to enter Brussels.
It was on the side of the <i xml:lang="be" lang="be">shipperke</i> dog mitrailleuse
battery which I had seen in the streets of Haelen, and
the peasant woman who shook her fist at the invader,
and all who had the <i xml:lang="be" lang="be">shipperke</i> spirit.</p>

<p>My empty appointment as the representative of the
American press with the British army was, at least,
taken seriously by the policeman at the War Office in
London when I returned from trips to France. The
day came when it was good for British trenches and
gun positions; when it was worth all the waiting, if
one wished to see the drama of modern war intimately.</p>

<span class="subhead">MONS AND PARIS</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The English base&mdash;Stories of the wounded&mdash;The cataclysm a
reality&mdash;London after Mons&mdash;The call to Englishmen&mdash;The
“Fog of war”&mdash;From Dieppe to Paris&mdash;The red trousers of
the French&mdash;Empty Paris&mdash;Can the German machine be held?&mdash;“The
French have not had their battle yet!”</p></blockquote>

<p>Back from Belgium to England; then across the Channel
again to Boulogne, where I saw the last of the
French garrison march away, their red trousers a
throbbing target along the road. From Boulogne the
British had advanced into Belgium. Now their base
was moved on to Havre. Boulogne, which two weeks
before had been cheering the advent of “Tommee Atkeens”
singing “Why should we be downhearted?”
was ominously lifeless. It was a town without soldiers,
a town of brick and mortar and pavements
whose very defencelessness was its security should the
Germans come.</p>

<p>The only British there were a few stray wounded
officers and men who had found their way back from
Mons. They had no idea where the British army
was. All they realised were sleepless nights, the
shock of combat, overpowering artillery fire, and resisting
the onslaught of outnumbering masses.</p>

<p>An officer of Lancers, who had ridden through the
German cavalry with his squadron, dwelt on the glory
of that moment. What did his wound matter? It
had come with the burst of a shell in a village street
which killed his horse after the charge. He had hobbled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
away, reached a railroad train, and got on board.
That was all he knew.</p>

<p>A Scotch private had been lying with his battalion
in a trench when a German aeroplane was sighted.
It had hardly passed by when showers of shrapnel
descended and the Germans, in that grey-green so
hard to see, were coming on as thick as locusts. Then
the orders came to fall back, and he was hit as his
battalion made another stand. He had crawled a
mile across the fields in the night with a bullet in his
arm. A medical corps officer told him to find any
transportation he could; and he, too, was able to get
aboard a train. That was all he knew.</p>

<p>These wounded had been tossed aside into eddies
by the maelstrom of action. They were interesting
because they were the first British wounded that I had
seen; because the war was young.</p>

<p>Back to London again to catch the mail with an
article. One was to “commute” to the war from
London as home. It was a base whence one sallied
forth to get peeps through the curtain of military
secrecy at the mighty spectacle. One soaked in England
at intervals and the war at intervals. Whenever
one stepped on the pier at Folkestone it was with a
breath of relief, born of a sense of freedom long associated
with fields and hedges on the other side of
the chalk cliffs which seemed to make the sequestering
barrier of the sea complete.</p>

<p>Those days of late August and early September,
1914, were gripping days to the memory. Eager
armies were pressing forward to a cataclysm no longer
of dread imagination but of reality. That ever deepening
and spreading stain from Switzerland to the
North Sea was as yet only a splash of fresh blood.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
One still wondered if one might not wake up in the
morning and find the war a nightmare. Pictures that
grow clearer with time, which the personal memory
chooses for its own, dissociate themselves from a background
of detail.</p>

<p>They were very quiet, this pair that sat at the next
table in the dining-room of a London hotel. I never
spoke to them, but only stole discreet glances as we
all will in irresistible temptation at any newly-wedded
couple. Neither was of the worldly type. One knew
that to this young girl London was strange; one knew
the type of country home which had given her that simple
charm which cities cannot breed; one knew, too,
that this young officer, her husband, waited for word
to go to the front.</p>

<p>Unconsciously she would play with her wedding-ring.
She stole covert glances at it and at him, of the
kind that bring a catch in the throat, when he was not
looking at her&mdash;which he was most of the time, for
reasons which were good and sufficient to others than
himself. Apprehended in “wool-gathering,” she
mustered a smile which was so exclusively for him
that the neighbour felt that he ought to be forgiven
his peeps from the tail of his eye at it because it was
so precious.</p>

<p>They would attempt little flights of talk about
everything except the war. He was most solicitous
that she should have something which she liked to eat,
while she was equally solicitous about him. Wasn’t
he going “out there”? And out there he would have
to live on army fare. It was all appealing to the old
traveller. And then the next morning&mdash;she was
alone, after she had given him that precious smile in
parting. The incident was one of the thousands before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
the war had become an institution, death a matter
of routine, and it was a commonplace for young
wives to see young husbands away to the front with a
smile.</p>

<p>One such incident does for all, whether the war is
young or old. There is nothing else to tell, even
when you know wife and husband. I was rather glad
that I did not know this pair. Then I should be looking
at the casualty list in the newspaper each morning
and I might not enjoy my faith that he will return
alive. These two seemed to me the best of England.
I used to think of them when gossip sought the latest
turn of intrigue under the mantle of censorship, when
Parliament poured out its oral floods and the newspapers
their volumes of words. The man went off
to fight; the woman returned to her country home. It
was the hour of war, not of talk.</p>

<p>On that Sunday in London when the truth about
Mons appeared stark to all England, another young
man happened to buy a special edition at a street corner
at the same time as myself. By all criteria, the
world and his tailor had treated him well and he deserved
well of the world. We spoke together about
the news. Already the new democracy which the war
had developed was in evidence. Everybody had common
thoughts and a common thing at stake, with
values reckoned in lives, and this makes for equality.</p>

<p>“It’s clear that we have had a bad knock. Why
deny it?” he said. Then he added quietly, after a
pause: “This is a personal call for me. I’m going
to enlist.”</p>

<p>England’s answer to that “bad knock” was out of
her experience. She had never won at first, but she
had always won in the end; she had won the last battle.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
The next day’s news was worse and the next
day’s still worse. The Germans seemed to be approaching
Paris by forced marches. Paris might fall&mdash;no
matter! Though the French army were shattered,
one heard Englishmen say that the British
would create an army to wrest victory from defeat.
The spirit of this was fine, but one realised the enormity
of the task; should the mighty German machine
crush the French machine, the Allies had lost. To say
so then was heresy, when the world was inclined to
think poorly of the French army and saw Russian numbers
as irresistible.</p>

<p>The personal call was to Paris before the fate of
Paris was to be decided. My first crossing of the
Channel had been to Ostend; the second, farther south
to Boulogne; the third was still farther south, to
Dieppe. Where next? To Havre! Events were
moving with the speed which had been foreseen with
myriads of soldiers ready to be thrown into battle by
the quick march of the railroad trains.</p>

<p>Every event was hidden under the “fog of war,”
then a current expression&mdash;meagre official bulletins
which read like hope in their brief lines, while the imagination
might read as it chose between the lines.
The marvel was that any but troop trains should run.
All night in that third-class coach from Dieppe to
Paris! Tired and preoccupied passengers; every
one’s heart heavy; every one’s soul wrenched; every
one prepared for the worst! You cared for no other
man’s views; the one thing you wanted was no bad
news. France had known that when the war came
it would be to the death. From the first no Frenchman
could have had any illusions. England had not
realised yet that her fate was with the soldiers of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
France, or France that her fate and all the world’s was
with the British fleet.</p>

<p>An Italian in our compartment would talk, however,
and he would keep the topic down to red
trousers, and to the red trousers of a French Territorial
opposite with an index finger when his gesticulatory
knowledge of the French language, which was
excellent, came to the rescue of his verbal knowledge,
which was poor. The Frenchman agreed that red
trousers were a mistake, but pointed to the blue covering
which he had for his cap&mdash;which made it all
right. The Italian insisted on keeping to the trousers.
He talked red trousers till the Frenchman got
out at his station and then turned to me to confirm his
views on this fatal strategic and tactical error of the
French. After all, he was more pertinent than most
of the military experts trying to write on the basis of
the military bulletins. It was droll to listen to this
sartorial discourse, when at least two hundred thousand
men lay dead and wounded from that day’s fight
on the soil of France. Red trousers were responsible
for the death of a lot of them.</p>

<p>Dawn, early September dawn, on dew-moist fields,
where the harvests lay unfinished as the workers, hastening
to the call of war, had left the work. Across
Paris, which seemed as silent as the fields, to a hotel
with empty rooms! Five hundred empty rooms, with
a clock ticking busily in every room! War or no war,
that old man who wound the clocks was making his
rounds softly through the halls from door to door.
He was a good soldier, who had heeded Joffre’s request
that every one should go on with his day’s work.</p>

<p>“They’re done!” said an American in the foyer.
“The French could not stand up against the Germans&mdash;anybody<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
anybody could see that! It’s too bad, but the
French are licked. The Germans will be here to-morrow
or the next day.”</p>

<p>I could not and would not believe it. Such a disaster
was against all one’s belief in the French army
and in the real character of the French people. It
meant that autocracy was making sport of democracy;
it meant disaster to all one’s precepts; a personal disaster.</p>

<p>“Look at that interior line which the French now
hold. Think of the power of the defensive with
modern arms. No! The French have not had their
battle yet!” I said.</p>

<p>And the British Expeditionary Force was still
intact; still an army, with lots of fight left in it.</p>

war”&mdash;“In spite of ’70, France still lived.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It was then that people were speaking of Paris as a
dead city&mdash;a Paris without theatres, without young
men, without omnibuses, with the shutters of its shops
down and its cafés and restaurants in gloomy emptiness.</p>

<p>The Paris the host of the idler and the traveller,
the Paris of the boulevards and the night life provided
for the tourist, the Paris that sparkled and
smiled in entertainment, the Paris exploited to the
average American through Sunday supplements and
the reminiscences of smoking-rooms of transatlantic
liners, was dead. Those who knew no other Paris
and conjectured no other Paris departed as from the
tomb of the pleasures which had been the passing extravaganza
of relief from dull lives elsewhere. The
Parisienne of that Paris spent a thousand francs to get
her pet dog safely away to Marseilles. Politicians
of a craven type, who are the curse of all democracies,
had gone to keep her company, leaving Paris cleaner
than ever she was after the streets had had their morning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
bath on a spring day when the horse chestnuts
were in bloom and Madame was arranging her early
editions on the table of her kiosk&mdash;a spiritually clean
Paris.</p>

<p>Monsieur, would you have America judged by the
White Way? What has the White Way to do with
the New York of Seventy-second Street or Harlem?
It serves the same purpose as the boulevards of furnishing
scandalous little paragraphs for foreign newspapers.
Foreigners visit it and think that they understand
how Americans live in Stockbridge, Mass.,
or Springfield, Ill. Empty its hotels and nobody but
sightseers and people interested in the White Way
would know the difference.</p>

<p>The other Paris, making ready to stand siege, with
the Government gone to Bordeaux with all the gold
of the Bank of France, with the enemy’s guns audible
in the suburbs and old men cutting down trees and
tearing up paving-stones to barricade the streets&mdash;never
had that Paris been more alive. It was after
the death of the old and the birth of the new Paris
that an elderly man, seeing a group of women at tea
in one of the few fashionable refreshment places which
were open, stopped and said:</p>

<p>“Can you find nothing better than that to do,
ladies, in a time like this?”</p>

<p>And the Latin temperament gave the world a surprise.
Those who judged France by her playful Paris
thought that if a Frenchman gesticulated so emotionally
in the course of every-day existence, he would get
overwhelmingly excited in a great emergency. One
evening, after the repulse of the Germans on the
Marne, I saw two French reserves dining in a famous
restaurant where, at this time of the year, four out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
of five diners ordinarily would be foreigners surveying
one another in a study of Parisian life. They
were big, rosy-cheeked men, country born and bred,
belonging to the new France of sports, of action, of
temperate habits, and they were joking about dining
there just as two sturdy Westerners might about dining
in a deserted Broadway. The foreigners and
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">demi-mondaines</i> were noticeably absent; a pair of
Frenchmen were in the place of the absentees; and
after their dinner they smoked their black briar-root
pipes in that fashionable restaurant.</p>

<p>Among the picture post-cards then on sale was one
of Marianne, who is France, bound for the front in
an aeroplane with a crowing French cock sitting on
the brace above her. Marianne looked as happy as
if she were going to the races; the cock as triumphant
as if he had a spur through the German eagle’s throat.
However, there was little sale for picture post-cards
or other trifles, while Paris waited for the siege.
They did not help to win victories. News and not
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">jeux d’esprit</i>, victory and not wit, was wanted.</p>

<p>For Marianne went to war with her liberty cap
drawn tight over her brow, a beat in her temples, and
her heart in her throat; and the cock had his head
down and pointed at the enemy. She was relieved
in a way, as all Europe was, that the thing had come;
at last an end of the straining of competitive taxation
and preparation; at last the test. She had no channel,
as England had, between her and the foe. Defeat
meant the heel of the enemy on her soil, German
sentries in her streets, submission. Long and hard
she had trained; while the outside world, thinking of
the Paris of the boulevards, thought that she could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
not resist the Kaiser’s legions. She was effeminate,
effete. She was all right to run cafés and make artificial
flowers, but she lacked beef. All the prestige
was with her enemy. In ’70 all the prestige had been
with her. For there is no prestige like military prestige.
It is all with those who won the last war.</p>

<p>“But if we must succumb, let it be now,” said the
French.</p>

<p>On, on&mdash;the German corps were coming like some
machine-controlled avalanche of armed men. Every
report brought them a little nearer Paris. Ah, monsieur,
they had numbers, those Germans! Every German
mother has many sons; a French mother only
one or two.</p>

<p>How could one believe those official <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">communiqués</i>
which kept saying that the position of the French
armies was favourable and then admitted that von
Kluck had advanced another twenty miles? The
heart of Paris stopped beating. Paris held its breath.
Perhaps the reason there was no panic was that
Parisians had been prepared for the worst.</p>

<p>What silence! The old men and women in the
streets moved as under a spell, which was the sense
of their own helplessness. But few people were
abroad, and those going on errands apparently. The
absence of traffic and pedestrians heightened the sepulchral
appearance to superficial observation. At the
windows of flats, inside the little shops, and on by-streets,
you saw waiting faces, every one with the
weight of national grief become personal. Was
Paris alive? Yes, if Paris is human and not bricks
and stone. Every Parisian was living a century in a
week. So, too, was one who loved France. In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
prospect of its loss he realised the value of all that
France stands for, her genius, her democracy, her
spirit.</p>

<p>One recalled how German officers had said that the
next war would be the end of France. An indemnity
which would crush out her power of recovery would
be imposed on her. Her northern ports would be
taken. France, the most homogeneous of nations,
would be divided into separate nationalities&mdash;even
this the Germans had planned. Those who read
their Shakespeare in the language they learned in
childhood had no doubt of England’s coming out of
the war secure; but if we thought which foreign civilisation
brought us the most in our lives, it was that
of France.</p>

<p>What would the world be without French civilisation?
To think of France dead was to think of cells
in your own brain that had gone lifeless; of something
irreparably extinguished to every man to whom
civilisation means more than material power of destruction.
The sense of what might be lost appealed
to you at every turn in scenes once merely characteristic
of a whole, each with an appeal of its own now;
in the types of people who, by their conduct in this
hour of trial, showed that Spartan hearts might beat
in Paris&mdash;the Spartan hearts of the mass of every-day,
work-a-day Parisians.</p>

<p>Those waiting at home calmly with their thoughts,
in a France of apprehension, knew that their fate was
out of their hands in the hands of their youth. The
tide of battle wavering from Meaux to Verdun might
engulf them; it might recede; but Paris would resist
to the last. That was something. She would resist
in a manner worthy of Paris; and one could live on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
very little food. Their fathers had. Every day that
Paris held out would be a day lost to the Germans and
a day gained for Joffre and Sir John French to bring
up reserves.</p>

<p>The street lamps should not reveal to Zeppelins or
Taubes the location of precious monuments. You
might walk the length of the Champs Élysées without
meeting a vehicle or more than two or three pedestrians.
The avenue was all your own; you might
appreciate it as an avenue for itself; and every building
and even the skyline of the streets you might appreciate,
free of any association except the thought of
the results of man’s planning and building. Silent,
deserted Paris by moonlight, without street lamps&mdash;few
had ever seen that. Millionaire tourists with
retinues of servants following them in automobiles
may never know this effect; nor the Parisienne who
paid a thousand francs to send her pet dog to Marseilles.</p>

<p>The moonlight threw the Arc de Triomphe in exaggerated
spectral relief, sprinkled the leaves of the
long rows of trees, glistened on the upsweep of the
broad pavements, gleamed on the Seine. Paris was
majestic, as scornful of Prussian eagles as the Parthenon
of Roman eagles. A column of soldiery marching
in triumph under the Arch might possess as a policeman
possesses; but not by arms could they gain
the quality that made Paris, any more than the Roman
legionary became a Greek scholar by doing sentry go
in front of the Parthenon. Every Parisian felt anew
how dear Paris was to him; how worthy of some great
sacrifice!</p>

<p>If New York were in danger of falling to an enemy,
the splendid length of Fifth Avenue and the majesty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
of the sky-scrapers of lower Broadway and the bay
and the rivers would become vivid to you in a way
they never had before; or Washington, or San Francisco,
or Boston&mdash;or your own town. The thing that
is a commonplace, when you are about to lose it takes
on a cherished value.</p>

<p>To-morrow the German guns might be thundering
in front of the fortifications. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">communiqués</i> from
Joffre became less frequent and more laconic. Their
wording was like some trembling, fateful needle of a
barometer, pausing, reacting a little, but going down,
down, down, indicator of the heart-pressure of Paris,
shrivelling the flesh, tightening the nerves. Already
Paris was in siege, in one sense. Her exits were
guarded against all who were not in uniform and
going to fight; to all who had no purpose except to see
what was passing where two hundred miles resounded
with strife. It was enough to see Paris itself awaiting
the siege; fighting one was yet to see to repletion.</p>

<p>The situation must be very bad or the Government
would not have gone to Bordeaux. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Alors</i>, one must
trust the army and the army must trust Joffre. There
is no trust like that of a democracy when it gives
its heart to a cause; the trust of the mass in the
strength of the mass which sweeps away the middleman
of intrigue.</p>

<p>And silence, only silence, in Paris; the silence of the
old men and the women, and of children who had
ceased to play and could not understand. No one
might see what was going on unless he carried a rifle.
No one might see even the wounded. Paris was
spared this, isolated in the midst of war. The
wounded were sent out of reach of the Germans in
case they should come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Then the indicator stopped falling. It throbbed
upward. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">communiqués</i> became more definite;
they told of positions regained, and borne in the ether
by the wireless of telepathy was something which confirmed
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">communiqués</i>. At first Paris was uneasy
with the news, so set had history been on repeating
itself, so remorselessly certain had seemed the German
advance. But it was true, true&mdash;the Germans
were going, with the French in pursuit, now twenty,
now thirty, now forty, now fifty, sixty, seventy miles
away from Paris. Yes, monsieur, seventy!</p>

<p>With the needle rising, did Paris gather in crowds
and surge through the streets, singing and shouting
itself hoarse, as it ought to have done according to the
popular international idea? No, monsieur, Paris will
not riot in joy in the presence of the dead on the battlefields
and while German troops are still within the
boundaries of France. Paris, which had been with
heart standing still and breathing hard, began to
breathe regularly again and the glow of life to run
through its veins. In the markets, whither Madame
brought succulent melons, pears, and grapes with commonplace
vegetables, the talk of bargaining housewives
with their baskets had something of its old vivacity
and Madame stiffened prices a little, for there
will be heavy taxes to pay for the war. Children, so
susceptible to surroundings, broke out of the quiet
alleys and doorways in play again.</p>

<p>A Sunday of relief, with a radiant September sun
shining, followed a Sunday of depression. The old
taxicabs and the horse vehicles with their venerable
steeds and drivers too old for service at the front,
exhumed from the catacomb of the hours of doubt,
ran up and down the Champs Élysées with airing parties.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
At Nôtre Dame the religious rejoicing was expressed.
A great service of prayer was held by the
priests who were not away fighting for France, as
three thousand are, while joyful prayers of thanks
shone on the faces of that democratic people who have
not hesitated to discipline the church as they have
disciplined their rulers. Groups gathered in the cafés
or sauntered slowly, talking less than usual, gesticulating
little, rolling over the good news in their minds
as something beyond the power of expression. How
banal to say, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">C’est chic, ça!</i>” or, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">C’est épatant!</i>”
Language is for little things.</p>

<p>That pile of posters at the American Embassy was
already historical souvenirs which won a smile. The
name of every American resident in Paris and his address
had been filled in the blank space. He had only
to put up the warning over his door that the premises
were under the Embassy’s protection. Ambassador
Herrick, suave, decisive, resourceful, possessed the
gift of acting in a great emergency with the same ease
and simplicity as in a small one, which is a gift sometimes
found wanting when a crisis breaks upon the
routine of official life.</p>

<p>He had the courage to act and the ability to secure
a favour for an American when it was reasonable; and
the courage to say “No” if it were unreasonable or
impracticable. No one of the throngs who had business
with him was kept long at the door in uncertainty.
In its organisation for facilitating the home-going of
the thousands of Americans in Paris and the Americans
coming to Paris from other parts of Europe, the
American Embassy in Paris seemed as well mobilised
for its part in the war as the German army.</p>

<p>In spite of ’70, France still lived. You noted the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
faces of the women in fresh black for their dead at the
front, a little drawn but proud and victorious. The
son or brother or husband had died for the country.
When a fast automobile bearing officers had a German
helmet or two displayed, the people stopped to
look. A captured German in the flesh on a front seat
beside a soldier chauffeur brought the knots to a standstill.
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Voilà! C’est un Allemand!</i>” ran the universal
exclamation. But Paris soon became used to
these stray German prisoners, left-overs from the German
retreat coming in from the fields to surrender.
The batches went through by train without stopping
for Paris, southward to the camps where they were to
be interned; and the trains of wounded to winter resorts,
whose hotels became hospitals, the verandas occupied
by convalescents instead of gossiping tourists.
It is <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">très à la mode</i> to be wounded, monsieur&mdash;<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">très
à la mode</i> all over Europe.</p>

<p>And, monsieur, all those barricades put up for
nothing! They will not need the cattle gathered on
Longchamps race-track and in the parks at Versailles
for a siege. The people who laid in stocks of canned
goods till the groceries of Paris were empty of everything
in tins&mdash;they would either have to live on
canned food or confess that they were pigs, <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">hein</i>?
Those volunteers, whether young men who had been
excused because they were only sons or for weak
hearts which now let them past the surgeons, whether
big, hulking farmers, or labourers, or stooped clerks,
drilling in awkward squads in the suburbs till they are
dizzy, they will not have to defend Paris; but, perhaps,
help to regain Alsace and Lorraine.</p>

<p>Then there were stories going the rounds; stories
of French courage and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élan</i> which were cheering to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
the ears of those who had to remain at home. Did
you hear about the big French peasant soldier who
captured a Prussian eagle in Alsace? They had him
come to Paris to give him the Legion of Honour and
the great men made a ceremony of it, gathering
around him at the Ministry of War. The simple
fellow looked from one to another of the group, surprised
at all this attention. It did not occur to him
that he had done anything remarkable. He had seen
a Prussian with a standard and taken the standard
away from that Prussian.</p>

<p>“If you like this so well,” said that droll one, “I’ll
try to get another!”</p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">C’est un vrai Français</i>, that <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">garçon</i>. What?</p>

<p>Though the Germans were going, the siege by the
cordon of French guards around Paris had not been
raised. To them every civilian was a possible spy.
So they let no civilians by. Must one remain forever
in Paris, screened from any view of the great drama?
Was there no way of securing a blue card which would
open the road to war for an atom of humanity who
wanted to see Frenchmen in action and not to pry into
generals’ plans?</p>

<p>Happily, an army winning is more hospitable than
an army losing; and bonds of friendship which stretch
around the world could be linked with authority which
has only to say the word in order that one might have
a day’s glimpse of the fields where von Kluck’s Germans
were showing their heels to the French.</p>

<p>Ours, I think, was the pioneer of the sightseeing
parties which afterward became the accepted form of
war correspondence with the French. None could
have been under more delightful auspices in companionship
or in the event. Victory was in the hearts of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
our hosts, who included M. Paul Doumer, formerly
president of the Chamber of Deputies and governor
of French Indo-China and now a senator, and General
Fevrier, of the French Medical Service, who was to
have had charge of the sanitation of Paris in case of
a siege.</p>

<p>M. Doumer was acting as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Chef de Cabinet</i> to General
Gallieni, the commandant of Paris, and he and
General Fevrier and two other officers of Gallieni’s
staff, who would have been up to their eyes in work
if there had been a siege, wanted to see something of
that army whose valour had given them a holiday.
Why should not Roberts and myself come along?
which is the pleasant way the French have of putting
an invitation.</p>

<p>The other member of the party was the veteran
European correspondent and representative of the Associated
Press in Paris, Elmer Roberts, who would
not be doing his duty to Melville E. Stone if he did not
arrange for opportunities of this kind. I was really
hanging onto Roberts’s coat-tails. Other men may
have publicity as individuals in a single newspaper or
magazine, but the readers of a thousand newspapers
take their news from Paris through him without knowing
his name.</p>

<p>Oh, the magic of a military pass and the companionship
of an officer in uniform! It separates you
from the crowd of millions on the other side of the
blank wall of military secrecy and takes you into the
area of the millions in uniform; it wins a nod of consent
from that middle-aged reservist on a road whose
bayonet has the police power of millions of bayonets
in support of its authority.</p>

<p>At last one was to see; the measure of his impressions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
was to be his own eyes and not the written reports.
Other passes I have had since, which gave me
the run of trenches and shell-fire areas; but this pass
opened the first door to the war. That day we ran
by Meaux and to Château Thierry to Soissons and
back by Senlis to Paris. We saw a finger’s breadth
of battle area; a pin point of army front. Only a ride
along a broad, fine road out of Paris, at first; a road
which our cars had all to themselves. Then at Claye
we came to the high-water mark of the German invasion.
This close to Paris in that direction and no
closer had the Germans come.</p>

<p>There was the field where the skirmishers had
turned back. Farther on, the branches of the avenue
of trees which shaded the road had been slashed as
if by a whirlwind of knives, where the French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">soixante-quinze</i>
field guns had found a target. Under that
sudden bath of projectiles, with the French infantry
pressing forward on their front, the German gunners
could not wait to take away the cord of five-inch shells
which they had piled to blaze their way to Paris. One
guessed their haste and their irritation. They were
within range of the fortifications; within two hours’
march of the suburbs of the Mecca of forty years of
preparation. After all that march from Belgium,
with no break in the programme of success, the
thunders broke and lightning flashed out of the
sky as Manoury’s army rushed upon von Kluck’s
flank.</p>

<p>“It was not the way that they wanted us to get
the shells,” said a French peasant, who was taking one
of the shell baskets for a souvenir. It would make
an excellent umbrella stand.</p>

<p>For the French it had been the turn of the tide;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
for that little British army which had fought its way
back from Mons it was the sweet dream, which had
kept men up on the retreat, come true. Weary Germans,
after a fearful two weeks of effort, became the
driven. Weary British and French turned drivers. A
hypodermic of victory renewed their energy. Paris
was at their back and the German backs in front.
They were no longer leaving their dead and wounded
behind to the foe; they were sweeping past the dead
and wounded of the foe.</p>

<p>But their happiness, that of a winning action, exalted
and passionate, had not the depths of that of the
refugees who had fled before the German hosts and
were returning to their homes in the wake of their
victorious army. We passed farmers with children
perched on top of carts laden with household goods
and drawn by broad-backed farm-horses, with usually
another horse or a milch cow tied behind. The real
power of France these peasants, holding fast to the
acres they own, with the fire of the French nature under
their thrifty conservatism. Others on foot were
villagers who had lacked horses or carts to transport
their belongings. In the packs on their backs were a
few precious things which they had borne away and
were now bearing back.</p>

<p>Soon they would know what the Germans had done
to their homes. What the Germans had done to one
piano was evident. It stood in the yard of a house
where grass and flowers had been trodden by horses
and men. In the sport of victory the piano had been
dragged out of the little drawing-room, while Fritz
and Hans played and sang in the intoxication of a
Paris gained, a France in submission. They did not
know what Joffre had in pickle for them. It had all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
gone according to programme up to that moment.
Nothing can stop us Germans! Champagne instead
of beer! Set the glass on top of the piano and sing!
Haven’t we waited forty years for this day?</p>

<p>Captured diaries of German officers, which reflect
the seventh heaven of elation suddenly turned into
grim depression, taken in connection with what one
saw on the battlefield, reconstruct the scene around
that piano. The cup to the lips; then dashed away.
How those orders to retreat must have hurt!</p>

<p>The state of the refugees’ homes all depended upon
the chances of war. War’s lightning might have hit
your roof tree and it might not. It plays no favourites
between the honest and the dishonest; the thrifty
and the shiftless. We passed villages which exhibited
no signs of destruction or of looting. The German
troops had marched through in the advance and
in the retreat without being billeted. A hurrying
army with another on its heels has no time for looting.
Other villages had been points of topical importance;
they had been in the midst of a fight. General <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mauvaise
Chance</i> had it in for them. Shells had wrecked
some houses; others were burned. Where a German
non-commissioned officer came to the door of a French
family and said that room must be made for German
soldiers in that house and if any one dared to interfere
with them he would be shot, there the exhausted human
nature of a people trained to think that “<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Krieg
ist Krieg</i>” and that the spoils of war are to the victor
had its way.</p>

<p>It takes generations to lift a man up a single degree;
but so swift is the effect of war, when men live a day
in a year, that he is demonised in a month. Before
the occupants had to go, often windows were broken,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
crockery smashed, closets and drawers rifled. The
soldiery which could not have its Paris “took it out”
of the property of their hosts. Looting, destruction,
one can forgive in the orgy of war which is organised
destruction; one can even understand rapine and
atrocities when armies, which include latent vile and
criminal elements, are aroused to the kind of insane
passion which war arouses in human beings. But
some indecencies one could not understand in civilised
men. All with a military purpose, it is said; for in
the nice calculations of a staff system which grinds
so very fine, nothing must be excluded that will embarrass
the enemy. A certain foully disgusting practice
was too common not to have the approval of at
least some officers, whose conduct in several châteaus
includes them as accomplices. Not all officers, not
all soldiers. That there should be a few is enough
to sicken you of belonging to the human species.
Nothing worse in Central America; nothing worse
where civilised degeneracy disgraces savagery.</p>

<p>But do not think that destruction for destruction’s
sake was done in all houses where German soldiers
were billeted. If the good principle was not sufficiently
impressed, Belgium must have impressed it; a
looting army is a disorderly army. The soldier has
burden enough to carry in heavy marching order without
souvenirs. That collector of the glass tops of
carafes who had thirty on his person when taken prisoner
was bound to be a laggard in the retreat.</p>

<p>To their surprise and relief, returning farmers
found their big, conical haystacks untouched, though
nothing could be more tempting to the wantonness of
an army on enemy soil. Strike a match and up goes
the harvest! Perhaps the Germans as they advanced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
had in mind to save the forage for their own horses,
and either they were running too fast to stop or the
staff overlooked the detail on the retreat.</p>

<p>It was amazing how few signs of battle there were
in the open. Occasionally one saw the hastily made
shelter trenches of a skirmish line; and again, the emplacements
for batteries&mdash;hurried field emplacements,
so puny beside those of trench warfare. It had been
open fighting; the tide of an army sweeping forward
and then, pursued, sweeping back. One side was trying
to get away; the other to overtake. Here, a rearguard
made a determined action which would have
had the character of a battle in other days; there, a
rearguard was pinched as the French or the British
got around it.</p>

<p>Swift marching and quick manœuvres of the type
which gave war some of its old sport and zest; the
advance, all the while gathering force, like the deep
tide! Crowds of men hurrying across a harvested
wheat-field or a pasture after all leave few marks of
passage. A day’s rain will wash away the blood
stains and liven trampled vegetation. Nature hastens
with a kind of contempt of man to repair the damage
done by his murderous wrath.</p>

<p>The cyclone past, the people turned out to put things
in order. Peasants too old to fight, who had paid the
taxes which paid for the rifles and guns and hell-fire,
were moving across the fields with spades, burying
the bodies of the young men and the horses that were
war’s victims. Long trenches full of dead told where
the eddy of battle had been fierce and the casualties
numerous; scattered mounds of fresh earth where they
were light; and sometimes, when the burying was unfinished&mdash;well,
one draws the curtain over scenes like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
that in the woods at Betz, where Frenchmen died
knowing that Paris was saved and Germans died knowing
that they had failed to take Paris.</p>

<p>Whenever we halted our statesman, M. Doumer,
was active. Did we have difficulties over a culvert
which had been hastily mended, he was out of the car
and in command. Always he was meeting some man
whom he knew and shaking hands like a senator at
home. At one place a private soldier, a man of education
by his speech, came running across the street at
sight of him.</p>

<p>“Son of an old friend of mine, from my town,”
said our statesman. Being a French private meant
being any kind of a Frenchman. All inequalities are
levelled in the ranks of a great conscript army.</p>

<p>Be it through towns unharmed or towns that had
been looted and shelled, the people had the smile of
victory, the look of victory in their eyes. Children
and old men and women, the stay-at-homes, waved to
our car in holiday spirit. The laugh of a sturdy
young woman who threw some flowers into the tonneau
as we passed, in her tribute to the uniform of the
army that had saved France, had the spirit of victorious
France&mdash;France after forty years’ waiting
throwing back a foe that had two soldiers to every one
of hers. All the land, rich fields and neat gardens
and green stretches of woods in the fair, rolling landscape,
basked in victory. Dead the spirit of any one
who could not, for the time being, catch the infection
of it and feel himself a Frenchman. Far from the
Paris of gay show for the tourist one seemed; in the
midst of the France of the farms and the villages
which had saved Paris and France.</p>

<p>The car sped on over the hard road. Staff officers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
in other cars whom we passed alone suggested that
there was war somewhere ahead. Were we never
going to reach the battle-line, the magnet of our speed
when a French army chauffeur made all speed laws
obsolete!</p>

<p>Shooting out of a grove, a valley made a channel
for sound that brought to our ears the thunder of
guns, the firing so rapid that it was like the roll of
some cyclopean snare-drum beaten with sticks the size
of ship-masts. From the crest of the next hill we had
a glimpse of an open sweep of parklike country toward
wooded hills. As far as we could see against
the background of the foliage throwing it into relief
was a continuous cloud of smoke from bursting shrapnel
shells, renewed with fresh, soft, blue puffs as fast
as it was dissipated.</p>

<p>This, then, was a battle. No soldiers, no guns in
sight; only a diaphanous, man-made nimbus against
masses of autumn green which was raining steel hail.
Ten miles of this, one would say; and under it lines
of men in blue coats and red trousers and green uniforms
hugging the earth, as unseen as a battalion of
ants at work in the tall grass. Even if a charge swept
across a field one would have been able to detect nothing
except moving pin-points on a carpet.</p>

<p>There was hard fighting; a lot of French and Germans
were being killed in the direction of Compiègne
and Noyon to-day. Another dip into another valley
and the thir-r-r of a rapid-firer and the muffled firing
of a line of infantry were audible. Yes, we were getting
up with the army, with one tiny section of it operating
along the road we were on. Multiply this by
a thousand and you have the whole.</p>

<p>Ahead was the army’s stomach on wheels; a procession<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
of big motor transport trucks keeping their
intervals of distance with the precision of a battleship
fleet at sea. We should have known that they belonged
to the army by the deafness of the drivers to appeals
to let us pass. All army transports are like that.
What the deuced right has anybody to pass? They
are the transport, and only fighting men belong in
front of them. Our automobile in trying to go by to
one side got stuck in a rut that an American car, built
for bad roads, would have made nothing of; which
proves again how clearly European armies are tied
to their fine roads. We got out, and here was our
statesman putting his shoulder to the wheel again.
That is the way of the French in war. Everybody
tries to help. By this time the transport chauffeurs
also remembered that they were Frenchmen; and as
Frenchmen are polite even in time of war, they let
us by.</p>

<p>A motor-cyclist approached with his hand up.</p>

<p>“Stop here!” he called.</p>

<p>Those transport chauffeurs who were deaf to ex-premiers
heard instantly and obeyed. In front of
them was a line of single horse-drawn carts, with an
extra horse in the rear. They could take paths that
the motor-trucks could not. Archaic they seemed, yet
friendly, as a relic of how armies were fed in other
days. For the first time I was realising what the
automobile means to war. It brings the army impedimenta
close up to the army’s rear; it means a reduction
of road space occupied by transport by three-quarters;
ease in keeping pace with food with the advance,
speed in falling back in case of retreat.</p>

<p>All that day I did not see a single piece of French
army transport broken down. And this army had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
been fighting for weeks; it had been an army on the
road. The valuable part of our experience was exactly
in this: a glimpse of an army in action after it
had been through all the vicissitudes that an army may
have in marching and counter-marching and attack.
Order one was to expect afterwards behind the siege
line of trenches when there had been time to establish
a routine; organisation and smooth organisation you
had here at the climax of a month’s strain. It told
the story of the character of the French army and the
reasons for its success other than its courage. The
brains were not all with the German Staff.</p>

<p>That winding road, with a new picture at every
turn, now revealed the town of Soissons in the valley
of the River Aisne. Soissons was ours, we knew,
since yesterday. How much farther had we gone?
Was our advance still continuing? For then, the winter
trench-fighting was unforeseen and the sightseers
thought of the French army as following up success
with success. Paris, rising from gloom to optimism,
hoped to see the Germans put out of France. The
appetite for victory grew after a week’s bulletins which
moved the flags forward on the map every day.</p>

<p>Another turn and Soissons was hidden from view
by a woodland. Here we came upon what looked like
a leisurely family party of reserves. The French
army, a small section of French army along a road!
And thus, if one would see the whole it must be in
bits along the roads when not on the firing-line. They
were sprawling in the fields in the genial afternoon
sun, looking as if they had no concern except to rest.
Uniforms dusty and faces tanned and bearded told
their story of the last month.</p>

<p>The duty of a portion of a force is always to wait<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
on what is being done by the others at the front.
These were waiting near a forks which could take
them to the right or the left, as the situation demanded.
At their rear, their supply of small arms
ammunition; in front, caissons of shells for a battery
speaking from the woods near by; a troop of cavalry
drawn up, the men dismounted, ready; and ahead of
them more reserves ready; everything ready.</p>

<p>This was where the general wanted the body of
men and equipment to be, and here they were. There
were no dragging ends in the rear, so far as I could
see; nobody complaining that food or ammunition was
not up; no aide looking for somebody who could not
be found; no excited staff officer rushing about shouting
for somebody to look sharp for somebody had
made a mistake. The thing was unwarlike; it was
like a particularly well-thought-out route march. Yet
at the word that company of cavalry might be in the
thick of it, at the point where they were wanted; the
infantry rushing to the support of the firing-line; the
motor transport facing around for withdrawal, if
need be. It was only a little way, indeed, into the
zone of death from the rear of that compact column.</p>

<p>Thousands of such compact bodies on as many
roads, each seemingly a force by itself and each a part
of the whole, which could be a dependable whole only
when every part was ready, alert, and up where it belonged!
Nothing can be left to chance in a battle-line
three hundred miles long. The general must
know what to depend on, mile by mile, in his plans.
Millions of human units are grouped in increasingly
larger units, harmonised according to set forms. The
most complex of all machines is that of a vast army,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
which yet must be kept most simple. No unit acts
without regard to the others; every one must know
how to do his part. The parts of the machine are
standardised. One is like the other in training, uniform,
and every detail, so that one can replace another.
Oldest of all trades this of war; old experts
the French. What one saw was like manœuvres. It
must be like manœuvres or the army would not hold
together. Manœuvres are to teach armies coherence;
war tries out that coherence, which you may not have
if some one does not know just what to do; if he is
uncertain in his rôle. Haste leads to confusion; haste
is only for supreme moments. In order to know how
to hasten when the hurry call comes, the mighty organism
must move in its routine with the smoothness
of a well-rehearsed play.</p>

<p>Joffre and the others who directed the machine must
know more than the mechanics of staff-control. They
must know the character of the man-material in the
machine. It was their duty as real Frenchmen to understand
Frenchmen, their verve, their restlessness for
the offensive, their individualism, their democratic intelligence,
the value of their elation, the drawback of
their tendency to depression and to think for themselves.
Indeed, the leader must counteract the faults
of his people and make the most of their virtues.</p>

<p>Thus, we had a French army’s historical part reversed:
a French army falling back and concentrating
on the Marne to receive the enemy blow. Equally
alive to German racial traits, the German Staff had
organised in their mass offensive the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élan</i> which means
fast marching and hard blows. Thus, we found the
supposedly excitable French digging in to receive the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
onslaught of the supposedly phlegmatic German.
When the time came for the charge&mdash;ah, you can
always depend on a Frenchman to charge!</p>

<p>Those reserves were pawns on a chessboard. They
appeared like it; one thought that they realised it.
Their individual intelligence and democracy had reasoned
out the value of obedience and homogeneity,
rather than accepted the dictum of any war lord. Difficult
to think that each had left a vacancy at a family
board; difficult to think that they were not automatons
in a process of endless routine of war; but not difficult
to learn that they were Frenchmen once we had
thrown our bombs in the midst of the group.</p>

<p>Of old, one knew the wants of soldiers. One
needed no hint of what was welcome at the front.
Never at any front were there enough newspapers or
tobacco. Men smoke twice as much as usual in the
strain of waiting for action, men who do not use tobacco
at all get the habit. Ask the G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;R. men who
fought in our great war if this is not true. Then,
too, when your country is at war, when back at home
hands stretch for every fresh edition and you at the
front know only what happens in your alley, think
what a newspaper from Paris means out on the battle-line
seventy miles from Paris. So I brought a
bundle of newspapers.</p>

<p>Monsieur, the sensation is beyond even the French
language to express&mdash;the sensation of sitting down
by the roadside with this morning’s edition and the
first cigarette for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">C’est épatant! C’est chic, ça! C’est magnifique!
Alors, nom de Dieu! Tiens! Hélas! Voilà!
Merci, mille remerciements!</i>”&mdash;it was an army of
Frenchmen with ready words, quick, telling gestures,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
pouring out their volume of thanks as the car sped by,
and we tossed out our newspapers at intervals, so that
all should have a look.</p>

<p>An <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Écho de Paris</i> that fell into the road was the
centre of a flag-rush, which included an officer. Most
unmilitary&mdash;an officer scrambling at the same time
as his men! In the name of the Kaiser, what discipline!</p>

<p>Then the car stopped long enough for me to see a
private give the paper to his officer, who was plainly
sensible of a loss of dignity, with the courtesy which
said, “A thousand pardons, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon capitaine</i>!” and
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">capitaine</i> began reading the newspaper aloud to
his men. Scores of human touches which were
French, republican, democratic!</p>

<p>With half our cigarettes gone, we fell in with some
brown-skinned, native African troops, the Mohammedan
Turcos. Their white teeth gleaming, their
black eyes devilishly eager, they began climbing onto
the car. We gave them all the cigarettes in sight; but
fortunately our reserve supply was not visible, and an
officer’s sharp command saved us from being invested
by storm.</p>

<p>As we came into Soissons we left the reserves behind.
They were kept back out of range of the German
shells, making the town a dead space between
them and the firing-line which was beyond. When
the Germans retreated through the streets the French
had taken care, as it was their town, to keep their fire
away from the cathedral and the main square to the
outskirts and along the river. Not so the German
guns when the French infantry passed through. Soissons
was not a German town.</p>

<p>We alighted from the car in a deserted street, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
all the shutters of shops that had not been torn down
by shell-fire closed. Soissons was as silent as the
grave, within easy range of many enemy guns. War
seemed only for the time being in this valley bottom
shut in from the roar of artillery a few miles away,
except for a French battery which was firing methodically
and slowly, its shells whizzing toward the ridge
back of the town.</p>

<p>The next thing that one wanted most was to go into
that battery and see the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">soixante-quinze</i> and their skilful
gunners. Our statesman said that he would try
to locate it. We thought that it was in the direction
of the river, that famous Aisne which has since given
its name to the longest siege-line in history; a small,
winding stream in the bottom of an irregular valley.
Both bridges across it had been cut by the Germans.
If that battery were on the opposite side under cover
of any one of a score of blots of foliage we could not
reach it. Another shot&mdash;and we were not sure that
the battery was not on the other side of the town; a
crack out of the landscape: this was modern artillery
fire to one who faced it. Apparently the guns of the
battery were scattered, according to the accepted practice,
and from the central firing-station word to fire
was being passed first to one gun and then to another.</p>

<p>Beside the buttress of one bridge lay two still figures
of Algerian Zouaves. These were fresh dead, fallen
in the taking of the town. Only two men! There
were dead by thousands which one might see in other
places. These two had leaped out from cover to dash
forward and bullets were waiting for them. They
had rolled over on their backs, their rigid hands still in
the position of grasping their rifles after the manner
of crouching skirmishers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Our statesman said that we had better give up trying
to locate the battery; and one of the officers called
a halt to trying to go up to the firing-line on the part
of a personally conducted party, after we stopped a
private hurrying back from the front on some errand.
With his alertness, the easy swing of his walk, his light
step, and that freedom in spirit and appearance, he
typified the thing which the French call <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élan</i>. Whenever
one asked a question of a French private you
could depend upon a direct answer. He knew or he
did not know. This definiteness, the result of military
training, as well as the Gallic lucidity of thought, is not
the least of the human factors in making an efficient
army, where every man and every unit must definitely
know his part. This young man, you realised, had
tasted the “salt of life,” as Lord Kitchener calls it.
He had heard the close sing of bullets; he had known
the intoxication of a charge.</p>

<p>“Does everything go well?” M. Doumer asked.</p>

<p>“It is not going at all, now. It is sticking,” was
the answer. “Some Germans were busy up there in
the stone quarries while the others were falling back.
They have a covered trench and rapid-fire gun positions
to sweep a zone of fire which they have
cleared.”</p>

<p>Famous stone quarries of Soissons, providing ready-made
dugouts as shelter from shells!</p>

<p>There is a story of how before Marengo Napoleon
heard a private saying: “Now this is what the general
ought to do!” It was Napoleon’s own plan revealed.
“You keep still!” he said. “This army
has too many generals.”</p>

<p>“They mean to make a stand,” the private went on.
“It’s an ideal place for it. There is no use of an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
attack in front. We’d be mowed down by machine
guns.” The br-r-r of a dozen shots from a German
machine gun gave point to his conclusion. “Our infantry
is hugging what we have and entrenching.
You better not go up. One has to know the way, or
he’ll walk right into a sharpshooter’s bullet”&mdash;instructions
that would have been applicable a year later when
you were about to visit a British trench in almost the
same location.</p>

<p>The siege warfare of the Aisne line had already
begun. It was singular to get the first news of it from
a private in Soissons and then to return to Paris and
London, on the other side of the curtain of secrecy,
where the public thought that the Allied advance
would continue.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Allons!</i>” said our statesman, and we went to the
town square, where German guns had carpeted the
ground with branches of shade trees and torn off the
fronts of houses, revealing sections of looted interior
which had been further messed by shell-bursts. Some
women and children and a crippled man came out-of-doors
at sight of us. M. Doumer introduced himself
and shook hands all around. They were glad to meet
him in much the same way as if he had been on an election
campaign.</p>

<p>“A German shell struck there across the square
only half an hour ago,” said one of the women.</p>

<p>“What do you do when there is shelling?” asked
M. Doumer.</p>

<p>“If it is bad we go into the cellar,” was the answer;
an answer which implied that peculiar fearlessness of
women, who get accustomed to fire easier than men.
These were the fatalists of the town, who would not
turn refugee; helpless to fight, but grimly staying with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
their homes and accepting what came with an incomprehensible
stoicism, which possibly had its origin in
a race-feeling so proud and bitter that they would not
admit that they could be afraid of anything German,
even a shell.</p>

<p>“And how did the Germans act?”</p>

<p>“They made themselves at home in our houses and
slept in our beds, while we slept in the kitchen,” she
answered. “They said if we kept indoors and gave
them what they wanted we should not be harmed.
But if any one fired a shot at their troops or any arms
were found in our houses, they would burn the town.
When they were going back in a great hurry&mdash;how
they scattered from <em>our</em> shells! We went out in the
square to see <em>our</em> shells, monsieur!”</p>

<p>What mattered the ruins of her home? <em>Our</em> shells
had returned vengeance.</p>

<p>Arrows with directions in German, “This way to
the river,” “This way to Villers-Cotteret,” were
chalked on the standing walls; and on door-casings the
names of the detachments of the Prussian Guard billeted
there, all in systematic Teutonic fashion.</p>

<p>“Prince Albrecht Joachim, one of the Kaiser’s sons,
was here and I talked with him,” said the Mayor, who
thought we should enjoy a morsel from court circles in
exchange for a copy of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Écho de Paris</i> which contained
the news that Prince Albrecht had been
wounded later. The mayor looked tired, this local
man of the people, who had to play the shepherd of a
stricken flock. Afterwards, they said that he deserted
his charge and a lady, Mme. Macherez, took his place.
All I know is that he was present that day; or at least
a man who was introduced to me as mayor; and he was
French enough to make a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon mot</i> by saying that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
feared there was some fault in his hospitality because
he had been unable to keep his guest.</p>

<p>“May I have this <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">confiture</i>?” asked a battle-stained
French orderly, coming up to him. “I found it in
that ruined house there&mdash;all the Germans had left.
I haven’t had a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">confiture</i> for a long time and, monsieur,
you cannot imagine what a hunger I have for <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">confitures</i>.”</p>

<p>All the while the French battery kept on firing
slowly, then again rapidly, their cracks trilling off like
the drum of knuckles on a table-top. Another effort
to locate one of the guns before we started back to
Paris failed. Speeding on, we had again a glimpse of
the landscape toward Noyon, sprinkled with shell-bursts.
The reserves were around their campfires
making savoury stews for the evening meal. They
would sleep where night found them on the sward
under the stars, as in wars of old. That scene
remains indelible as one of many while the army was
yet mobile, before the contest became one of the mole
and of the beaver.</p>

<p>Though one had already seen many German prisoners
in groups and convoys, the sight of two on the
road fixed the attention because of the surroundings
and the contrast suggested between French and German
natures. Both were young, in the very prime of
life, and both Prussian. One was dark-complexioned,
with a scrubbly beard which was the product of the
war. He marched with such rigidity that I should not
have been surprised to see him break into a goose-step.
The other was of that mild, blue-eyed, tow-haired type
from the Baltic provinces, with the thin white skin
which does not tan but burns. He was frailer than the
other and he was tired; oh, how tired! He would lag<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
and then stiffen back his shoulders and draw in his chin
and force a trifle more energy into his step.</p>

<p>A typical, lively French soldier was escorting the
pair. He looked pretty tired, too, but he was getting
over the ground in the natural, easy way in which man
is meant to walk. The aboriginal races, who have a
genius for long distances on foot, do not march in the
German fashion, which looks impressive, but lacks
endurance. By the same logic, the cayuse’s gait is
better for thirty miles day in and day out than the high-stepping
carriage horse’s.</p>

<p>You could realise the contempt which those two
martial Germans had for their captor. Four or five
peasant women refugees by the roadside unloosened
their tongues in piercing feminine satire and upbraiding.</p>

<p>“You are going to Paris, after all! This is what
you get for invading our country; and you’ll get more
of it!”</p>

<p>The little French soldier held up his hand to the
women and shook his head. He was a chivalrous fellow,
with imagination enough to appreciate the feelings
of an enemy who has fought hard and lost. Such
as he would fight fair and hold this war of the civilisations
up to something like the standards of civilisation.</p>

<p>The very tired German stiffened up again, as his
drill sergeant had taught him, and both stared straight
ahead, proud and contemptuous, as their Kaiser would
wish them to do. I should recognise the faces of these
two Germans and of that little French guard if I saw
them ten years hence. In ten years, what will be the
Germans’ attitude toward this war and their military
lords?</p>

<p>It is not often that one has a senator for a guide;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
and I never knew a more efficient one than our statesman.
His own curiosity was the best possible aid in
satisfying our own. Having seen the compactness and
simplicity of an army column at the front, we were to
find that the same thing applied to high command. A
sentry and a small flag at the doorway of a village
hotel: this was the headquarters of the Sixth Army,
which General Manoury had formed in haste and flung
at von Kluck with a spirit which crowned his white
hairs with the audacity of youth. He was absent, but
we might see something of the central direction of one
hundred and fifty thousand men in the course of one of
the most brilliant manœuvres of the war, before staffs
had settled down to office existence in permanent quarters.
That is, we might see the little there was to see:
a soldier telegrapher in one bedroom, a soldier typewritist
in another, officers at work in others. One
realised that they could pack up everything and move
in the time it takes to toss enough clothes into a bag to
spend a night away from home. Apparently, when
the French fought they left red tape behind with the
bureaucracy.</p>

<p>From his seat before a series of maps on a sitting-room
table an officer of about thirty-five rose to receive
us. It struck me that he exemplified self-possessed intelligence
and definite knowledge; that he had coolness
and steadiness plus that acuteness of perception and
clarity of statement which are the gift of the French.
You felt sure that no orders which left his hand wasted
any words or lacked explicitness. The Staff is the
brains of the army, and he had brains.</p>

<p>“All goes well!” he said, as if there were no more
to say. All goes well! He would say it when things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
looked black or when they looked bright, and in a way
that would make others believe it.</p>

<p>Outside the hotel were no cavalry escorts or commanders,
no hurrying orderlies, none of the legendary
physical activity that is associated with an army headquarters.
An automobile drove up, an officer got out;
another officer descended the stairs to enter a waiting
car. The wires carry word faster than the cars.
Each subordinate commander was in his place along
that line where we had seen the puffs of smoke against
the landscape, ready to answer a question or obey an
order. That simplicity, like art itself, which seems so
easy is the most difficult accomplishment of all in war.</p>

<p>After dark, in a drizzling rain, we came to what
seemed to be a town, for our automobile lamps spread
their radiant streams over wet pavements. But these
were the only lights. Tongues of loose brick had
been shot across the cobblestones and dimly the jagged
skyline of broken walls of buildings on either side
could be discovered. It was Senlis, the first town I
had seen which could be classified as a town in ruins.
Afterwards, one became a sort of specialist in ruins,
comparing the latest with previous examples of destruction.</p>

<p>Approaching footsteps broke the silence. A small,
very small, French soldier&mdash;he was not more than
five feet two&mdash;appeared and we followed him to an
ambulance that had broken down for want of gasoline.
It belonged to the Société de Femmes de France. The
little soldier had put on a uniform as a volunteer for
the only service his stature would permit. In those
days many volunteer organisations were busy seeking
to “help.” There was a kind of competition among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
them for wounded. This ambulance had got one and
was taking him to Paris, off the regular route of the
wounded who were being sent south. The boot-soles
of a prostrate figure showed out of the dark recess of
the interior. This French officer, a major, had been
hit in the shoulder. He tried to control the catch in
his voice which belied his assertion that he was suffering
little pain. The drizzling rain was chilly. It was
a long way to Paris yet.</p>

<p>“We will make inquiries,” said our kindly general.</p>

<p>A man who came out of the gloom said that there
was a hospital kept by some Sisters of Charity in Senlis
which had escaped destruction. The question was
put into the recesses of the ambulance:</p>

<p>“Would you prefer to spend the night here and go
on in the morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur, I&mdash;should&mdash;like&mdash;that&mdash;better!”
The tone left no doubt of the relief that the
journey in a car with poor springs was not to be continued
after hours of waiting, marooned in the street
of a ruined town.</p>

<p>While the ambulance passed inside the hospital gate,
I spoke with an elderly woman who came to a nearby
door. Cool and definite she was as a French soldier,
bringing home the character of the women of France
which this war has made so well-known to the world.</p>

<p>“Were you here during the fighting?”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur, and during the shelling and the
burning. The shelling was not enough. The Germans
said that some one fired on their soldiers&mdash;a
boy, I believe&mdash;so they set fire to the houses. One
could only look and hate and pray as their soldiers
passed through, looking so unconquerable, making
all seem so terrible for France. Was it to be ’70<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
over again? One’s heart was of stone, monsieur.
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Tiens!</i> They came back faster than they went. A
mitrailleuse was down there at the end of the street,
our mitrailleuse! The bullets went cracking by.
They crack, the bullets; they do not whistle like the
stories say. Then the street was empty of Germans
who could run. The dead they could not run, nor the
wounded. Then the French came up the street, running,
too&mdash;running after the Germans. It was good,
monsieur, good, good! My heart was not of stone
then, monsieur. It could not beat fast enough for happiness.
It was the heart of a girl. I remember it all
very clearly. I always shall, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Allons!</i>” said our statesman. “The officer is
well cared for.”</p>

<p>The world seemed normal again as we passed
through other towns unharmed and swept by the dark
countryside, till a red light rose in our path and a
sharp “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Qui vive?</i>” came out of the night as we slowed
down. This was not the only sentry call from a
French Territorial in front of a barricade.</p>

<p>At a second halt we found a chain as well as a barricade
across the road. For a moment it seemed that
even the suave parliamentarism of our statesman or
the authority of our general and our passes could not
convince one grizzled reservist, doing his duty for
France at the rear while the young men were at the
front, that we had any right to be going into Paris at
that hour of the night. The password, which was
“Paris,” helped, and we felt it a most appropriate
password as we came to the broad streets of the city
that was safe.</p>

<p>There is a popular idea that Napoleon was a super-genius
who won all his battles alone. It is wrong.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
He had a lot of Frenchmen along to help. Much the
same kind of Frenchmen live to-day. Not until they
fought again would the world believe this. It seems
that the excitable Gaul, whom some people thought
would become demoralised in face of German organisation,
merely talks with his hands. In a great crisis
he is cool, as he always was. I like the French for
their democracy and humanity. I like them, too, for
leaving their war to France and Marianne; for not
dragging in God as do the Germans. For it is just
possible that God is not in the fight. We don’t know
that He even approved of the war.</p>

<span class="subhead">AND CALAIS WAITS</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Calais, the objective of a struggle for world power&mdash;Last reserves
of the British&mdash;A city of refugees&mdash;Heroic care of the wounded&mdash;“Life
going on as usual”&mdash;The cheerful Belgians&mdash;In a
French hospital&mdash;An astonished but happy Tommy.</p></blockquote>

<p>To the traveller, Calais had been the symbol of the
shortest route from London to Paris, the shortest spell
of torment in crossing the British Channel. It was a
point where one felt infinite relief or sad physical
anticipations. In the last days of November Calais
became the symbol of a struggle for world power.
The British and the French were fighting to hold
Calais; the Germans to get it. In Calais Germany
would have her foot on the Atlantic coast. She could
look across only twenty-two miles of water to the chalk
cliffs at Dover. She would be as near her rival as
twice the length of Manhattan Island; within the range
of a modern gun; within an hour by steamer and
twenty minutes by aeroplane.</p>

<p>The long battle-front from Switzerland to the
North Sea had been established. There was no getting
around the Allied flank; there had ceased to be a
flank. To win Calais, Germany must crush through
without any manœuvre by main force. From the cafés
where the British newspaper men gathered England received
its news, which they gleaned from refugees and
stragglers and passing officers. They wrote something
every day, for England must have something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
about that dizzy head-on wrestle in the mud, that
writhing line of changing positions, of new trenches
rising behind the old destroyed by German artillery.
The British were fighting with their last reserves on
the Ypres-Armentieres line. The French divisions to
the south were suffering no less heavily, and beyond
them the Belgians were trying to hold the last strip of
their land under Belgian sovereignty. Cordons of
guards which kept back the observer from the struggle
could not keep back the truth. Something ominous
was in the air.</p>

<p>It was worth while being in that old town as it
waited on the issue in the late October rains. Its
fishermen crept out in the mornings from the shelter
of its quays, where refugees gathered in crowds
hoping to get away by steamer. Like lost souls, carrying
all the possessions they could on their backs,
these refugees. There was numbness in their movements
and their faces were blank&mdash;the paralysis of
brain from sudden disaster. The children did not
cry, but munched the dry bread which their parents
gave them mechanically.</p>

<p>The newspaper men said that “refugee stuff” was
already stale; eviction and misery were stale. Was
Calais to be saved? That was the only question. If
the Germans came, one thought that Madame at the
hotel would still be at her desk, unruffled, businesslike,
and she would still serve an excellent salad for
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déjeuner</i>; the fishermen would still go out to sea for
their daily catch.</p>

<p>What was going to happen? What might not happen?
It was human helplessness to the last degree
for all behind the wrestlers. Fate was in the battle-line.
There could be no resisting that fate. If the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
Germans came, they came. Belgian staff officers with
their high-crowned, gilt-braided caps went flying by in
their cars. There always seemed a great many
Belgian staff officers back of the Belgian army in the
restaurants and cafés. Habit is strong, even in war.
They did not often miss their <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déjeuners</i>. On the Dixmude
line all that remained of the active Belgian Army
was in a death struggle in the rain and mud. To these
<i xml:lang="be" lang="be">shipperkes</i>, honour without stint, as to their gallant
king.</p>

<p>Slightly wounded Belgians and Belgian stragglers
roamed the streets of Calais. Some had a few belongings
wrapped up in handkerchiefs. Others had only
the clothes on their backs. Yet they were cheerful;
this was the amazing thing. They moved about,
laughing and chatting in groups. Perhaps this was
the best way. Possibly the relief at being out of the
hell at the front was the only emotion they could feel.
But their cheerfulness was none the less a dash of sunlight
for Calais.</p>

<p>The French were grim. They were still polite;
they went on with their work. No unwounded French
soldiers were to be seen, except the old Territorials
guarding the railroad and the highways. The military
organisation of France, which knew what war
meant and had expected war, had drawn every man
to his place and held him there with the inexorable
hand of military and racial discipline. Calais had
never considered caring for wounded, and the
wounded poured in. I saw an automobile with a
wounded man stop at a crowded corner, in the midst
of refugees and soldiers; a doctor was leaning over
him, and he died while the car waited.</p>

<p>But the newspaper men were saying that stories of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
wounded men were likewise stale. So they were, for
Europe was red with wounded. Train after train
brought in its load from the front, and Calais tried to
care for them. At least, it had buildings which would
give shelter from the rain. On the floor of a railroad
freight shed the wounded lay in long rows, with just
enough space between them to make an alley. Those
in the row against one of the walls were German prisoners.
Their green uniforms melted into the stone of
the wall and did not show the mud stains. Two
slightly wounded had their heads together whispering.
They were helplessly tired, though not as tired as most
of the others, those two stalwart young men; but they
seemed to be relieved, almost happy. It did not matter
what happened to them, now, so long as they could
rest.</p>

<p>Next to them a German was dying, and others badly
hit were glassy-eyed in their fatigue and exhaustion.
This was the word, exhaustion, for all the wounded.
They had not the strength for passion or emotion.
The fuel for those fires was in ashes. All they wanted
in this world was to lie quiet; and some fell asleep not
knowing or caring probably whether they were in Germany
or in France. In the other rows, in contrast with
this chameleon, baffling green, were the red trousers
of the French and the dark blue of the Belgian uniforms,
sharing the democracy of exhaustion with their
foe.</p>

<p>A misty rain was falling. In a bright spot of light
through a window one by one the wounded were being
lifted up on to a seat, if they were not too badly hit,
and onto an operating-table if they were very badly
hit. A doctor and a sturdy Frenchwoman of about
thirty, in spotless white, were in charge. Another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
woman undid the first-aid bandage and others applied
a spray. No time was lost; there were too many
wounded to care for. The thing must be done as rapidly
as possible before another train-load came in. If
these attendants were tired, they did not know it any
more than the wounded had realised their fatigue in
the passion of battle. The improvised arrangement to
meet an emergency had an appeal which more elaborate
arrangements of organisation which I had seen
lacked. It made war a little more red; humanity a
little more human and kind and helpless under the
scourge which it had brought on itself.</p>

<p>Though Calais was not prepared for wounded,
when they came the women of energy and courage
turned to the work without jealousy, without regard
to red tape, without fastidiousness. I have in mind
half a dozen other women about the streets that day in
uniforms of short skirts and helmets, who belonged to
some volunteer organisation which had taken some
care as to its regimentals. They were types not characteristic
of the whole, of whom one practical English
doctor said: “We don’t mind as long as they do not
get in the way.” Their criticisms of Calais and the
arrangements were outspoken; nothing was adequate;
conditions were filthy; it was shameful. They were
going to write to the English newspapers about it and
appeal for money. When they had organised a
proper hospital, one should see how the thing ought
to be done. Meantime, these volunteer Frenchwomen
were doing the best they knew how and doing
it now.</p>

<p>A fine-looking young Frenchman who had a shell-wound
in the thigh was being lifted onto the table.
He shuddered with pain, as he clenched his teeth; yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
when the dressing was finished he was able to breathe
his thanks. On the seat was a Congo negro who had
been with one of the Belgian regiments, coal black and
thick-lipped, with bloodshot eyes; an unsensitised human
organism, his face as expressionless as his bare
back with holes made by shell-fragments. A young
Frenchwoman&mdash;she could not have been more than
nineteen&mdash;with a face of singular refinement, sprayed
his wounds with the definiteness of one trained to such
work, though two days before it had probably never
occurred to her as being in the possibilities of her existence.
Her coolness and the coolness of the other
women in their silent activity had a charm that went
with one’s devout respect.</p>

<p>The French wounded, too, were silent, as if in the
presence of a crisis which overwhelmed their personal
thoughts. Help was needed at the front; they knew
it. On sixty trains in one day sixty thousand French
passed through Calais. With a pass from the French
commandant at Calais, I got aboard one of these
trains down at the railroad yards at dawn. This lot
were Turcos, in command of a white-haired veteran
of African campaigns. An utter change of atmosphere
from the freight shed! Perhaps it is only the
wounded who have time to think. My companions in
the officers’ car were as cheery as the brown devils
whom they led. They had come from the trenches
on the Marne, and their commissariat was a boiled
ham, some bread and red wine. Enough! It was
war time, as they said.</p>

<p>“We were in the Paris railroad yards. That is all
we saw of Paris, and in the night. Hard luck!”</p>

<p>They had left the Marne the previous day. By
night they could be in the fight. It did not take long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
to send reinforcements when the line was closed to all
except military traffic and one train followed close on
the heels of another.</p>

<p>They did not know where they were going. One
never knew where. Probably they would get orders
at Dunkirk. Father Joffre, when there was a call for
reinforcements never was in a panicky hurry about it.
He seemed to understand that the general who made
the call could hold out a little longer; but the reinforcements
were always up on time. A long head had
Father Joffre.</p>

<p>Now I am going to say that life was going on as
usual at Dunkirk; that is the obvious thing to say.
The nearer the enemy, the more characteristic that
trite observation of those who have followed the roads
of war in Europe. At Dunkirk you might have a
good meal within sound of the thunder of the guns of
the British monitors which were helping the Belgians
to hold their line. At Dunkirk most excellent pastry
was for sale in a confectionery shop. Why shouldn’t
tartmakers go on making tarts and selling them?
The British naval reserve officers used to take tea in
this shop. Little crowds of citizens who had nothing
to do, which is the most miserable of vocations in such
a crisis, gathered to look at armoured motor cars which
had come in from the front with bullet dents, which
gave them the atmosphere of battle.</p>

<p>Beyond Dunkirk, one might see wounded Belgians
fresh from the front, staggering in, crawling in, hobbling
in from under the havoc of shell-fire, their first-aid
bandages saturated with mud, their ungainly and
impracticable uniforms oozing mud, ghosts of men&mdash;these
<i xml:lang="be" lang="be">shipperkes</i> of the nation that was unprepared for
war, who had done their part, when the only military<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
thought was for more men, unwounded men, British,
French, Belgian, to stem the German tide. Yet many
of these Belgians, even these, were cheerful. They
could still smile and say, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bonne chance!</i>”</p>

<p>Indeed, there seemed no limit to the cheerfulness of
Belgians. At a hospital in Calais I met a Belgian professor
with his head a white ball of bandages, showing
a hole for one eye and a slit for the mouth. He had
been one of the cyclist force which took account of
many German cavalry scouts in the first two weeks of
the war. A staff automobile had run over him on the
road.</p>

<p>“I think the driver of the car was careless,” he said
mildly, as if he were giving a gentle reproof to a student.</p>

<p>By contrast, he had reason to be thankful for his lot.
Looked after by a brave man attendant in another
room were the wounded who were too horrible to see;
who must die. Then in another, you had a picture of
a smiling British regular, with a British nurse and an
Englishwoman of Calais to look after him. They
read to him, they talked to him, they vied with each
other in rearranging his pillows or bedclothes. He
was a hero of a story; but it rather puzzled him why
he should be. Why were a lot of people paying so
much attention to him for doing his duty?</p>

<p>In the cavalry, he had been separated from his regiment
on the retreat from Mons. Wandering about
the country, he came up with a regiment of cuirassiers
and asked if he might not fight with them. A number
of the cuirassiers spoke English. They took him into
the ranks. The regiment went far over on the Marne,
through towns with French names which he could not
pronounce, this man in khaki with the French troopers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
He was marked. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">C’est un Anglais!</i> People cheered
him and threw flowers to him in regions which had
never seen one of the soldiers of the Ally before.</p>

<p>Yes, officers and gentlemen invited him to dine, like
he was a gentleman, he said, and not a Tommy, and
the French Government had given him a decoration
called the Legion of Honour or something like that.
This was all very fine; but the best thing was that his
own colonel, when he returned, had him up before his
company and made a speech to him for fighting with
the French when he could not find his own regiment.
He was supremely happy, this Tommy. In waiting
Calais one might witness about all the emotions and
contrasts of war&mdash;and many which one does not find
at the front.</p></div>

<span class="subhead">IN GERMANY</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The other side of the shield&mdash;A German guard&mdash;A people organised&mdash;A
machine of psychical force&mdash;“A people who think only
in the offensive”&mdash;A nation trained to win&mdash;At a Berlin hotel&mdash;Bluffing

<p>Never had the war seemed a more monstrous satire
than on that first day in Germany as the train took me
to Berlin. It was the other side of the wall of gun
and rifle-fire, where another set of human beings were
giving life in order to take life. The Lord had fashioned
them in the same pattern on both sides. Their
children were born in the same way; they bled from
wounds in the same way&mdash;but why go on in this
vicious circle of thought? My impressions of Germany
were brief and the clearer, perhaps, for being
brief and drawn on the fresh background of Paris and
Calais waiting to know their fate; of England staring
across the Channel in a suspense which her phlegmatic
nature would not confess to learn the result of the battle
for the Channel ports; of England and France
straining with all their strength to hold, while the Germans
exerted all theirs to gain, a goal; of Holland,
solid mistress of her neutrality, fearing for it and
profiting by it while she took in the Belgian foundlings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
dropped on her steps&mdash;Holland, that little land at
peace, with the storms lashing around her.</p>

<p>The stiff and soldierly appearing reserve officer with
bristling Kaiserian moustache, so professedly alert
and efficient, who looked at the mottled back of my
passport and frowned at the recent visa, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">A la Place
de Calais, bon pour aller à Dunkerque, P.&nbsp;O. Le Chef
d’État Major</i>,” but let me by without questions or
fuss, aroused visions of a frontier stone wall studded
with bayonets.</p>

<p>For something about him expressed a certain character
of downright militancy lacking in either an
English or a French guard. I could imagine his contempt
for both and particularly for a “sloppy, undisciplined”
American guard, as he would have called one
of ours. Personal feelings did not enter into his
thoughts. He had none; only national feelings, this
outpost of the national organism. The mood of the
moment was friendliness to Americans. Germany
wished to create the impression on the outside world
through the agency of the neutral press that she was
in danger of starving, while she amassed munitions for
her summer campaign and the Allies were lulled into
confidence of siege by famine rather than by arms. A
double, a treble purpose the starving campaign served;
for it also ensured economy of foodstuffs, while
nothing so puts the steel into a soldier’s heart
as the thought that the enemy is trying to beat him
through taking the bread out of his mouth and the
mouths of the women and children dependent upon
him.</p>

<p>Tears and laughter and moods and passions organised!
Seventy million in the union of determined
earnestness of a life-and-death issue! Germany had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
studied more than how to make war with an army.
She had studied how the people at home should help an
army to make war.</p>

<p>“With our immense army, which consists of all the
able-bodied youth of the people,” as a German officer
said, “when we go to war the people must all be passionate
for war. Their impulse must be the impulse
of the army. Their spirit will drive the army on.
They must be drilled, too, in their part. No item in
national organisation is too small to have its effect.”</p>

<p>Compared to the French, who had turned grim and
gave their prayers as individuals to hearten their
soldiers, the Germans were as responsive as a stringed
instrument to the master musician’s touch. A whisper
in Berlin was enough to set a new wave of passion
in motion, which spread to the trenches east and
west. Something like the team work of the “rah-rah”
of college athletics was applied to the nation.
The soft pedal on this emotion, the loud on that, or a
new cry inaugurated which all took up, not with the
noisy, paid insincerity of a claque, but with the vibrant
force of a trained orchestra with the brasses predominant.</p>

<p>There seemed less of the spontaneity of an individualistic
people than of the exaltation of a religious
revival. If the army were a machine of material
force, then the people were a machine of psychical
force. Though the thing might leave the observer
cold, as a religious revival leaves the sceptic, yet he
must admire. I was told that I should succumb to the
contagion as others had; but it was not the optimism
which was dinned into my ears that affected me as
much as side lights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
When Corey and I took a walk away from a railway
station where I had to make a train connection, I
saw a German reservist of forty-five, who was helping
with one hand to thresh the wheat from his farm, on
a grey, lowering winter day. The other hand was in
a bandage. He had been allowed to go home until he
was well enough to fight again. The same sort of
scene I had witnessed in France; the wounded man
trying to make up to his family the loss of his labour
during his absence at the front.</p>

<p>Only, that man in France was on the defensive; he
was fighting to hold what he had and on his own soil.
The German had been fighting on the enemy’s soil to
gain more land. He, too, thought of it as the defensive.
All Germany insisted that it was on the defensive.
But it was the defensive of a people who think
only in the offensive. That was it&mdash;that was the
vital impression of Germany revealed in every conversation
and every act.</p>

<p>The Englishman leans back on his oars; the German
leans forward. The Englishman’s phrase is “stick
it,” which means to hold what you have; the German’s
phrase is “onward.” It was national youth
against national middle age. A vessel with pressure
of increase from within was about to expand or
burst. A vessel which is large and comfortable
for its contents was resisting pressure from without.
The French were saying, What if we should
lose? and the Germans were saying, What if
we should not win all that we are entitled to? Germany
had been thinking of a mightier to-morrow and
England of a to-morrow as good as to-day. Germany
looked forward to a fortune to be won at thirty;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
England considered the safeguarding of her fortune
at fifty.</p>

<p>It is not professions that count so much as the thing
that works out from the nature of a situation and
the contemporaneous bent of a people. The English
thought of his defence as keeping what he already had;
the German was defending what he considered that he
was entitled to. If he could make more of Calais than
the French, then Calais ought to be his. A nation with
the “closed in” culture of the French on one side and
the enormous, unwieldy mass of Russia on the other,
convinced of its superiority and its ability to beat either
foe, thought that it was the friend of peace because
it had withheld the blow. When the striking
time came, it struck hard and forced the battle on
enemy soil, which proved, to its logic, that it was only
receiving payment of a debt owed it by destiny.</p>

<p>Bred to win, confident that the German system was
the right system of life, it could imagine the German
Michael as the missionary of the system, converting
the Philistine with machine guns. Confidence, the
confidence which must get new vessels for the energy
that has overflowed, the confidence of all classes in the
realisation of the long-promised day of the “place in
the sun” for all the immense population drilled in the
system, was the keynote. They knew that they could
lick the other fellow and went at him from the start
as if they expected to lick him, with a diligence
which made the most of their training and preparation.</p>

<p>When I asked for a room with a bath in a leading
Berlin hotel, the clerk at the desk said, “I will see,
sir.” He ran his eye up and down the list methodically
before he added: “Yes, we have a good room<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
on the second floor.” Afterward, I learned that all
except the first and second floors of the hotel were
closed. The small dining-room only was open, and
every effort was made to make the small dining-room
appear normal.</p>

<p>He was an efficient clerk; the buttons boy who
opened the room door, a goose-stepping, alert sprout
of German militarism, exhibited a punctiliousness of
attention which produced a further effect of normality.
Those Germans who were not doing their part at the
front were doing it at home by bluffing the other Germans
and themselves into confidence. The clerk
believed that some day he would have more guests than
ever and a bigger hotel. All who suffered from the
war could afford to wait. Germany was winning; the
programme was being carried out. The Kaiser said
so. In proof of it, multitudes of Russian soldiers
were tilling the soil in place of Germans, who were at
the front taking more Russian soldiers.</p>

<p>Everybody that one met kept telling him that everything
was perfectly normal. No intending purchaser
of real estate in a boom town was ever treated to more
optimistic propaganda. Perfectly normal&mdash;when
one found only three customers in a large department
store! Perfectly normal&mdash;when the big steamship
offices presented in their windows bare blue seas which
had once been charted with the going and coming of
German ships! Perfectly normal&mdash;when the spool
of the killed and wounded rolled out by yards like that
of a ticker on a busy day on the Stock Exchange!
Perfectly normal&mdash;when women tried to smile in the
streets with eyes which had plainly been weeping at
home! Are you for us or against us? The question
was put straight to the stranger. Let him say that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
was a neutral and they took it for granted that he was
pro-Ally. He must be pro-something.</p>

<p>As Corey and I returned to the railway station after
our walk, a soldier took us in charge and marched us
to the office of the military commandant. “Are you
an Englishman?” was his first question. The guttural
military emphasis which he put on Englishman
was most significant. Which brings us to another factor
in the psychology of war: hate.</p>

<p>“If men are to fight well,” said a German officer,
“it is necessary that they hate. They must be exalted
by a great passion when they charge into machine
guns.”</p>

<p>Hate was officially distilled and then instilled&mdash;hate
against England, almost exclusively. The public
rose to that. If England had not come in, the German
military plan would have succeeded: first, the
crushing of France; then, the crushing of Russia.
The despised Belgian, that small boy who had tripped
the giant and then hugged the giant’s knees, delaying
him on the road to Paris, was having a rest. For he
had been hated very hard for a while with the hate of
contempt&mdash;that miserable pigmy who interfered with
the plans of the machine.</p>

<p>The French were almost popular. The Kaiser had
spoken of them as “brave foes.” What quarrel
could France and Germany have? France had been
the dupe of England. Cartoons of the hairy, barbarous
Russian and the futile little Frenchman in his long
coat, borne on German bayonets or pecking at the
boots of a giant Michael, were not in fashion. For
Germany was then trying to arrange a separate peace
with both France and Russia. France was to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
Alsace-Lorraine as the price of the arrangement.
When the negotiations fell through the cartoonists
were free to make sport of the anæmic Gaul and the
untutored Slav again. And it was not alone in Germany
that a responsive press played the weather vane
to Government wishes. But in Germany the machinery
ran smoothest.</p>

<p>For the first time I knew what it was to have a
human being whom I had never seen before hate me.
At sight of me a woman who had been a good Samaritan,
with human kindness and charity in her eyes,
turned a malignant devil. Stalwart as Minerva she
was, a fair-haired German type of about thirty-five,
square-shouldered and robustly attractive in her Red
Cross uniform. Being hungry at the station at Hanover,
I rushed out of the train to get something to eat,
and saw some Frankfurter sandwiches on a table in
front of me as I alighted.</p>

<p>My hand went out for one, when I was conscious of
a movement and an exclamation which was hostile,
and looked up to see Minerva, as her hand shot out to
arrest the movement of mine, with a blaze of hate,
hard, merciless hate, in her eyes, while her lips framed
the word, “Englisher!” If looks were daggers I
should have been pierced through the heart. Perhaps
an English overcoat accounted for her error. Certainly
I promptly recognised mine when I saw that this
was a Red Cross buffet. An Englishman had dared
to try to buy a sandwich meant for German soldiers!
She might at least glory in the fact that her majestic
glare had made me most uncomfortable as I murmured
an apology, which she received with a stony
frown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
A moment later a soldier approached the buffet. She
leaned over smiling, as gentle as she had been fierce
and malignant a moment before, making a picture, as
she put some mustard on a sandwich for him, which
recalled that of the Frenchwoman among the
wounded in the freight shed at Calais&mdash;a simile
which would anger them both.</p>

<p>The Frenchwoman, too, had a Red Cross uniform;
she, too, expressed the mercy and gentle ministration
which we like to associate with woman. But there
was the difference of the old culture and the new; of
the race which was fighting to have and the race which
was fighting to hold. The tactics which we call the
offensive was in the German woman’s, as in every
German’s, nature. It had been in the Frenchwoman’s
in Napoleon’s time. Many racial hates the war has
developed; but that of the German is a seventeen-inch-howitzer-asphyxiating-gas
hate.</p>

<p>If hates help to win, why not hate as hard as you
can? Don’t you go to war to win? There is no use
talking of sporting rules and saying that this and that
is “not done” in humane circles&mdash;win! The Germans
meant to win. Always I thought of them as
having the spirit of the Middle Ages in their hearts,
organised for victory by every modern method.
Three strata of civilisation were really fighting, perhaps:
The French, with its inherent individual patriotism
which makes a Frenchman always a Frenchman,
its philosophy which prevents increase of numbers,
its thrift and tenacity; the German, with its
newborn patriotism, its discovery of what it thinks
is the golden system, its fecundity, its aggressiveness,
its industry, its ambition; and the Russian, unformed,
groping, vague, glamorous, immense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
The American is an outsider to them all; some
strange melting-pot product of many races which is
trying to forget the prejudices and hates of the old
and perhaps not succeeding very well, but not yet convinced
that the best means of producing patriotic unity
is war. After this and other experiences, after being
given a compartment all to myself by men who glanced
at me with eyes of hate and passed on to another compartment
which was already crowded or stood up in
the aisle of the car, I made a point of buying an American
flag for my buttonhole.</p>

<p>This helped; but still there was my name, which belonged
to an ancestor who had gone from England to
Connecticut nearly three hundred years ago. Palmer
did not belong to the Germanic tribe. He must be
pro- the other side. He could not be a neutral and
belong to the human kind with such a name. Only
Swenson, or Gansevoort, or Ah Fong could really be
a neutral; and even they were expected to be on your
side secretly. If they weren’t they must be on the
other. Are you for us? or, Are you against us? I
grew weary of the question in Germany. If I had
been for them I would have “dug in” and not told
them. In France and England they asked you objectively
the state of sentiment in America. But, possibly,
the direct, forcible way is the better for war
purposes when you mean to win; for the Germans
have made a study of war. They are experts in
war.</p>

<p>However, this rosy-cheeked German boy, in his
green uniform which could not be washed clean of
all the stains of campaigning, whom I met in the palace
grounds at Charlottenberg, did not put this tiresome
question to me. He was the only person I saw in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
grounds, whose quiet I had sought for an hour’s respite
from war. One could be shown through the
palace by the lonely old caretaker, who missed the
American tourist, without hearing a guide’s monotone
explaining who the gentleman in the frame was and
what he did and who painted his picture. This boy
could have more influence in making me see the German
view-point than the propagandist men in the
Government offices and the belligerent German-Americans
in hotel lobbies&mdash;those German-Americans who
were so frequently in trouble in other days for disobeying
the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">verbotens</i> and then asking our State Department
to get them out of it, now pluming themselves
over victories won by another type of German.</p>

<p>About twenty-one this boy, round-faced and blue-eyed,
who saw in Queen Louisa the most beautiful
heroine of all history. The hole in his blouse which
the bullet had made was nicely sewed up and his wound
had healed. He was fighting in France when he was
hit; the name of the place he did not know. Karl,
his chum, had been killed. The doctor had given him
the bullet, which he exhibited proudly as if it were
different from other bullets, as it was to him. In a
few days he must return to the front. Perhaps the
war would be over soon; he hoped so.</p>

<p>The French were brave; but they hated the Germans
and thought that they must make war on the
Germans, and they were a cruel people, guilty of many
atrocities. So the Fatherland had fought to conquer
the enemies who planned her destruction. A peculiar,
childlike <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">naïveté</i> accompanied his intelligence, trained
to run in certain grooves, which is the product of the
German type of popular education; that trust in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
superiors which comes from a diligent and efficient
paternalism. He knew nothing of the atrocities
which Germans were said to have committed in Belgium.
The British and the French had set Belgium
against Germany and Germany had to strike Belgium
for playing false to her treaties. But he did think
that the French were brave; only misled by their Government.
And the Kaiser? His eyes lighted in a
way that suggested that the Kaiser was almost a god
to him. He had heard of the things that the British
said against the Kaiser and they made him want to
fight for his Kaiser. He was only one German&mdash;but
the one was millions.</p>

<p>In actual learning which comes from schoolbooks,
I think that he was better informed than the average
Frenchman of his class; but I should say that he had
thought less; that his mind was more of a hothouse
product of a skilful nurseryman’s hand, who knew the
value of training and feeding and pruning the plant
if you were to make it yield well. A kindly, willing,
likable boy, peculiarly simple and unspoiled, it seemed
a pity that all his life he should have to bear the brand
of the <i>Lusitania</i> on his brow; that event which history
cannot yet put in its true perspective. Other races
will think <i>Lusitania</i> when they meet a German long
after the Belgian atrocities are forgotten. It will
endure to plague a people like the exile of the
Acadians, the guillotining of innocents in the French
Revolution, and the burning of the Salem witches.
But he had nothing to do with it. A German admiral
gave an order as a matter of policy to make an impression
that his submarine campaign was succeeding
and to interfere with the transport of munitions, and
the Kaiser told this boy that it was right. One liked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
this boy, his loyalty and his courage; liked him as a
human being. But one wished that he might think
more. Perhaps he will one of these days, if he survives
the war.</p></div>

<span class="subhead">HOW THE KAISER LEADS</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>A prisoners’ “show” camp&mdash;Filthy conditions&mdash;Scanty fare&mdash;Racial
characteristics&mdash;“Upholding Britain’s dignity”&mdash;Russian
princes in disguise&mdash;A blind artist&mdash;A physical insult&mdash;Deadly
monotony of prison life&mdash;Drilling&mdash;Hamburg a dead city&mdash;A
hate of the pocket&mdash;The “system” at a Berlin hospital&mdash;Effects
of the war in Berlin&mdash;At the Opera&mdash;A plethora of Iron
Crosses&mdash;Immanence of the Kaiser&mdash;Imperial propaganda&mdash;The
Crown Prince marooned&mdash;Glory to the Kaiser and von
Hindenburg&mdash;President of the German Corporation&mdash;Always
the offensive&mdash;“America too far away!”</p></blockquote>

<p>Only a week before I had seen the wounded Germans
in the freight shed at Calais and all the prisoners
that I had seen elsewhere, whether in ones or twos,
brought in fresh from the front or in columns under
escort, had been Germans. The sharpest contrast of
all in war which the neutral may observe is seeing the
men of one army which, from the other side, he
watched march into battle&mdash;armed, confident, disciplined
parts of an organisation, ready to sweep all
before them in a charge&mdash;become so many sheep, disarmed,
disorganised, rounded up like vagrants in a
bread-line and surrounded by a fold of barbed wire
and sentries. Such was the lot of the nine thousand
British, French, and Russians whom I saw at Döberitz,
near Berlin. This was a show camp, I was told, but
it suffices. Conditions at others might be worse;
doubtless were. England treated its prisoners best,
unless my information from unprejudiced observers
is wrong. But Germany had enormous numbers of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
prisoners. A nation in her frame of mind thought
only of the care of the men who could fight for her,
not of those who had fought against her.</p>

<p>Then, the German nature is one thing and the
British another. Crossing the Atlantic on the <i>Lusitania</i>
we had a German reserve officer who was already
on board when the evening editions arrived at the pier
with news that England had declared war on Germany.
Naturally, he must become a prisoner upon
his arrival at Liverpool. He was a steadfast German.
When a wireless report of the German repulse
at Liége came, he would not believe it. Germany had
the system and Germany would win. But when he
said, “I should rather be a German on board a British
ship than a Briton on board a German ship, under the
circumstances,” his remark was significant in more
ways than one.</p>

<p>His English fellow-passengers on that splendid
liner which a German submarine was to send to the
bottom showed him no discourtesy. They passed the
time of day with him and seemed to want to make his
awkward situation easy. Yet it was apparent that he
regarded their kindliness as a racial weakness. <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Krieg
ist Krieg.</i> When Germany made war she made war.</p>

<p>So allowances are in order. One prison camp was
like another in this sense, that it deprived a man of his
liberty. It put him in jail. The British regular, who
is a soldier by profession, was, in a way, in a separate
class. But the others were men of civil industries and
settled homes. Except during their term in the army,
they went to the shop or the office every day, or tilled
their farms. They were free; they had their work to
occupy their minds during the day and freedom of
movement when they came home in the evening.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
They might read the news by their firesides; they
were normal human beings in civilised surroundings.</p>

<p>Here, they were pacing animals in a cage, commanded
by two field guns, who might walk up and
down and play games and go through the daily drill
under their own non-commissioned officers. It was
the mental stagnation of the thing that was appalling.
Think of such a lot for a man used to action in civil
life&mdash;and they call war action! Think of a writer,
a business man, a lawyer, a doctor, a teacher, reduced
to this fenced-in existence, when he had been the kind
who got impatient if he had to wait for a train that
was late! Shut yourself up in your own backyard
with a man with a rifle watching you for twenty-four
hours and see whether, if you have the brain of a
mouse, prison-camp life can be made comfortable, no
matter how many greasy packs of cards you have.
And lousy, besides! At times one had to laugh over
what Mark Twain called “the damfool human race!”</p>

<p>Inside a cookhouse at one end of the enclosure was
a row of soup boilers. Outside were a series of railings,
forming stalls for the prisoners when they lined
up for meals. In the morning, some oatmeal and
coffee; at noon, some cabbage soup boiled with
desiccated meal and some bread; at night, more coffee
and bread. How one thrived on this fare depended
much upon how he liked cabbage soup. The Russians
liked it. They were used to it.</p>

<p>“We never keep the waiter late by tarrying over
our liqueurs,” said a Frenchman.</p>

<p>Our reservist guide had run away to America in
youth, where he had worked at anything he could find
to do; but he had returned to Berlin, where he had a
“good little business” before the war. He was stout<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
and cheery, and he referred to the prisoners as “boys.”
The French and Russians were good boys; but the
English were bad boys, who had no discipline. He
said that all received the same food as German soldiers.
It seemed almost ridiculous chivalry that men
who had fought against you and were living inactive
lives should be as well fed as the men who were fighting
for you. The rations that I saw given to German
soldiers were better. But that was what the
guide said.</p>

<p>“This is our little sitting-room for the English non-commissioned
officers,” he explained, as he opened the
door of a small shanty which had a pane of glass for a
window. Some men sitting around a small stove
arose. One, a big sergeant-major, towered over the
others; he had the colours of the South African campaign
on the breast of his worn khaki blouse and stood
very straight, as if on parade. By the window was a
Scot in kilts, who was equally tall. He looked around
over his shoulder and then turned his face away with
the pride of a man who does not care to be regarded
as a show. His uniform was as neat as if he were at
inspection; and the way he held his head, the haughtiness
of his profile against the stream of light, recalled
the unconquerable spirit of the Prussian prisoner
whom I had seen on the road during the fighting along
the Aisne. Only a regular, but he was upholding the
dignity of Britain in that prison camp better than
many a member of Parliament on the floor of the
House of Commons. I asked our guide about him.</p>

<p>“A good boy, that! All his boys obey him, and he
obeys all the regulations. But he acts as if we Germans
were his prisoners.”</p>

<p>The British might not be good boys, but they would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
be clean. They were diligent in the chase in their
underclothes; their tents were free of odour; and there
was something resolute about a Tommy who was bare
to the waist in that freezing wind, making an effort at
a bath. I heard tales of Mr. Atkins’ characteristic
thoughtlessness. While the French took good care
of their clothes and kept their tents neat, he was likely
to sell his coat or his blanket if he got a chance in
order to buy something that he liked to eat. One
Tommy who sat on his stray tick inside the tent was
knitting. When I asked him where he had learned
to knit, he replied: “India!” and gave me a look
as much as to say, “Now pass on to the next cage.”</p>

<p>The British looked the most pallid of all, I thought.
They were not used to cabbage soup. Their stomachs
did not take hold of it, as one said; and they loathed
the black bread. No white bread and no jam! Only
when you have seen Mr. Atkins with a pot of jam and
a loaf of white bread and some bacon frizzling near
by can you realise the hardship which cabbage soup
meant to that British regular who gets lavish rations
of the kind he likes along with his shilling a day for
professional soldiering.</p>

<p>“You see, the boys go about as they please,” said
our guide. “They don’t have a bad time. Three
meals a day and nothing to do.”</p>

<p>Members of a laughing circle which included some
British were taking turns at a kind of Russian blind
man’s buff, which seemed to me about in keeping with
the mental capacity of a prison camp.</p>

<p>“No French!” I remarked.</p>

<p>“The French keep to themselves, but they are good
boys,” he replied. “Maybe it is because we have only
a few of them here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
Every time one sounded the subject he was struck
by the attitude of the Germans toward the French,
not alone explained by the policy of the hour which
hoped for a separate peace with France. Perhaps it
was best traceable to the Frenchman’s sense of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">amour
propre</i>, his philosophy, his politeness, or an indefinable
quality in the grain of the man.</p>

<p>The Germans affected to look down on the French;
yet there was something about the Frenchman which
the Germans had to respect&mdash;something not won by
war. I heard admiration for them at the same time
as contempt for their red trousers and their unpreparedness.
While we are in this avenue, German
officers had respect for the dignity of British officers,
the leisurely, easy quality of superiority which they
preserved in any circumstances. The qualities of a
race come out in adversity no less than in prosperity.
Thus, their captors regarded the Russians as big,
good-natured children.</p>

<p>“Yes, they play games and we give the English an
English newspaper to read twice a week,” said our
affable guide, unconscious, I think, of any irony in the
remark. For the paper was the <cite>Continental News</cite>,
published in “the American language” for American
visitors. You may take it for granted that it did not
exaggerate any success of the Allies.</p>

<p>“We have a prince and the son of a rich man
among the Russian prisoners&mdash;yes, quite in the Four
Hundred,” the guide went on. “They were such
good boys we put them to work in the cookhouse.
Star boarders, eh? They like it. They get more to
eat.”</p>

<p>These two men were called out for exhibition.
Youngsters of the first line they were and even in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
privates’ uniforms they bore the unmistakable signs
of belonging to the Russian upper class. Each saluted
and made his bow, as if he had come on to do a turn
before the footlights. It was not the first time they
had been paraded before visitors. In the prince’s eye
I noted a twinkle, which as much as said: “Well,
why not? We don’t mind.”</p>

<p>When we were taken through the cookhouse I asked
about a little Frenchman, who was sitting with his nose
in a soup bowl. He seemed too near-sighted ever to
get into any army. His face was distinctly that of a
man of culture; one would have guessed that he was
an artist.</p>

<p>“Shrapnel burst,” explained the guide. “He will
never be able to see much again. We let him come in
here to eat.”</p>

<p>I wanted to talk with him, but these exhibitions
are supposed to be all in pantomime; a question and
you are urged along to the next exhibit. He was
young and all his life he was to be like that&mdash;like
some poor, blind kitten!</p>

<p>The last among a number of Russians returning to
the enclosure from some fatigue duty was given a blow
in the seat of his baggy trousers with a stick which
one of the guards carried. The Russian quickened
his steps and seemed to think nothing of the incident.
But to me it was the worst thing that I saw at Döberitz,
this act of physical violence against a man by one
who has power over him. The personal equation was
inevitable to the observer. Struck in that way, could
one fail to strike back? Would not he strike in red
anger, without stopping to think of consequences?
There is something bred into the Anglo-Saxon nature
which resents a physical blow. We courtmartial an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
officer for laying hands on a private, though that
private may get ten years in prison on his trial. Yet
the Russian thought nothing of it, or the guard, either.
An officer in the German or the Russian army may
strike a man.</p>

<p>“Would the guard hit a Frenchman in that way?”
I asked. Our guide said not; the French were good
boys. Or an Englishman? He had not seen it done.
The Englishman would swear and curse, he was sure,
and might fight, they were such undisciplined boys.
But the Russians&mdash;“they are like kids. It was only
a slap. Didn’t hurt him any.”</p>

<p>New barracks for the prisoners were being built
which would be comfortable if crowded, even in winter.
The worst thing, I repeat, was the deadly monotony
of the confinement for a period which would
end only when the war ended. Any labour should be
welcome to a healthy-minded man. It was a mercy
that the Germans set prisoners to grading roads, to
hoeing and harvesting, retrieving thus a little of the
wastage of war. Or was it only the bland insistence
that conditions were luxurious that one objected to?&mdash;not
that they were really bad. The Germans had
a horde of prisoners to care for; vast armies to maintain;
and a new volunteer force of a million or more&mdash;two
millions was the official report&mdash;to train.</p>

<p>While we were at the prison camp we heard at
intervals the rap-rap of a machine gun at the practice
range near by, drilling to take more prisoners, and on
the way back to Berlin we passed on the road companies
of volunteers returning from drill with that sturdy
march characteristic of German infantry.</p>

<p>In Berlin we were told again that everything was
perfectly normal. Trains were running as usual to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
Hamburg, if we cared to go there. “As usual” in
war time was the ratio of one to five in peace time.
At Hamburg, in sight of steamers with cold boilers
and the forest of masts of idle ships, one learned
what sea power meant. That city of eager shippers
and traders, that doorstep of Germany, was as dead
as Ypres, without a building being wrecked by shells.
Hamburgers tried to make the best of it; they assumed
an air of optimism; they still had faith that richer
cargoes than ever might come over the sea, while a
ghost, that of bankruptcy, walked the streets, looking
at office windows and the portholes of the ships.</p>

<p>For one had only to scratch the cuticle of that
optimism to find that the corpuscles did not run red.
They were blue. Hamburg’s citizens had to exhibit
the fortitude of those of Rheims under another kind
of bombardment: that of the silent guns of British
dreadnoughts far out of range. They were good
Germans; they meant to play the game; but that once
prosperous business man of past middle age, too old
to serve, who had little to do but think, found it hard
to keep step with the propagandist attitude of Berlin.</p>

<p>A free city, a commercial city, a city unto itself,
Hamburg had been in other days a cosmopolitan
trader with the rest of the world. It had even been
called an English city, owing to the number of English
business men there as agents of the immense commerce
between England and Germany. Every one
who was a clerk or an employer spoke English; and
through all the irritation between the two countries
which led up to the war, English and German business
men kept on the good terms which traffic requires and
met at luncheons and dinners and in their clubs. Englishmen
were married to German women and Germans<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
to Englishwomen, while both prayed that their governments
would keep the peace.</p>

<p>Now the English husband of the German woman,
though he had spent most of his life in Hamburg,
though perhaps he had been born in Germany, had
been interned and, however large his bank account,
was taking his place with his pannikin in the stalls in
front of some cookhouse for his ration of cabbage
soup. Germans were kind to English friends personally;
but when it came to the national feeling of Germany
against England, nowhere was it so bitter as in
Hamburg. Here the hate was born of more than
national sentiment; it was of the pocket; of seeing fortunes
that had been laboriously built dwindling, once
thriving businesses in suspended animation. There
was no moratorium in name; there was worse than one
in fact. A patriotic freemasonry in misfortune took
its place. No business man could press another for
the payment of debts lest he be pressed in turn. What
would happen when the war was over? How long
would it last?</p>

<p>It was not quite as cruel to give one’s opinion as
two years to the inquirers in Hamburg as to the director
of the great Rudolph Virchow Hospital in Berlin.
Here, again, the system; the submergence of the
individual in the organisation. The wounded men
seemed parts of a machine; the human touch which
may lead to disorganisation less in evidence than at
home, where the thought is: This is an individual
human being, with his own peculiarities of temperament,
his own theories of life, his own ego; not just
a quantity of brain, tissue, blood, and bone which is
required for the organism called man. A human
mechanism wounded at the German front needed repairs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
and the repairs were made to that mechanism.
The niceties might be lacking, but the repair factory
ran steadily and efficiently at full blast. Germany had
to care for her wounded by the millions and by the
millions she cared for them.</p>

<p>“Two years!”</p>

<p>I was sorry that I had said this to the director, for
its effect on him was like a blow in the chest. The
vision of more and more wounded seemed to rise before
the eyes of this kindly man weary with the strain
of doing the work which he knew so well how to do as
a cog in the system. But for only a moment. He
stiffened; he became the drillmaster again; and the
tragic look in his eyes was succeeded by one of that
strange exaltation I had seen in the eyes of so many
Germans, which appeared to carry their mind away
from you and their surroundings to the battlefield
where they were fighting for their “place in the sun.”</p>

<p>“Two years, then. We shall see it through!”</p>

<p>He had a son who had been living in a French family
near Lille studying French and he had heard nothing
of him since the war began. They were good
people, this French family; his son liked them. They
would be kind to him; but what might not the French
Government do to him, a German! He had heard
terrible stories&mdash;the kind of stories that hardened the
fighting spirit of German soldiers&mdash;about the treatment
German civilians had received in France. He
could think of one French family which he knew as
being kind, but not of the whole French people as a
family. As soon as the national and racial element
were considered the enemy became a beast.</p>

<p>To him, at least, Berlin was not normal; nor was
it to that keeper of a small shop off Unter den Linden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
which sold prints and etchings and cartoons. What
a boon my order of cartoons was to him! He forgot
his psychology code and turned human and confidential.
The war had been hard on him; there was no
business at all, not even in cartoons.</p>

<p>The Opera alone seemed something like normal to
one who trusted his eyes rather than his ears for information.
There was almost a full house for the
“Rosenkavalier”; for music is a solace in time of
trouble, as other capitals than Berlin revealed. Officers
with close-cropped heads wearing Iron Crosses,
some with arms in slings, promenading in the refreshment
room of the Berlin Opera House between the
acts&mdash;this in the hour of victory should mean a picture
of gaiety. But there was a telling hush about the
scene. Possibly music had brought out the truth in
men’s hearts that war, this kind of war, was not gay
or romantic, only murderous and destructive. One
had noticed already that the Prussian officer, so conscious
of his caste, who had worked so indefatigably
to make an efficient army, had become chastened. He
had found that common men, butchers and bakers and
candlestick makers, could be as brave for their Kaiser
as he. And more of these officers had the Iron Cross
than not.</p>

<p>The plenitude of Iron Crosses appealed to the risibilities
of the superficial observer. But in this, too,
there was system. An officer who had been in several
battles without winning one must feel a trifle declassed
and that it was time for him to make amends to his
pride. If many were given to privates then the average
soldier would not think the Cross a prize for the
few who had luck, but something that he, too, might
win by courage and prompt obedience to orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
The masterful calculation, the splendid pretence
and magnificent offence, could not hide the suspense
and suffering. Nowhere were you able to forget the
war or to escape the all-pervading influence of the
Kaiser. The empty royal box at the opera, his opera,
called him to mind. What would happen before he
reappeared there for a gala performance? When
again in the shuffle of European politics would the
audience see the Czar of Russia or the King of England
by his side?</p>

<p>It was his Berlin, the heart of his Berlin, that was
before you when you left the opera&mdash;the new Berlin,
taking few pages of a guide book compared to
Paris, which he had fathered in its boom growth. In
front of his palace Russian field guns taken by von
Hindenburg at Tannenberg were exhibited as the
spoils of his war; while the Never-to-be-Forgotten
Grandfather in bronze rode home in triumph from
Paris not far away.</p>

<p>One wondered what all the people in the ocean of
Berlin flats were thinking as one walked past the
statue of Frederick the Great, with his sharp nose
pointing the way for future conquerors, and on along
Unter den Linden, with its broad pavements gleaming
in a characteristic, misty winter night, through the
Brandenburg Gate of his Brandenburg dynasty, or to
the statue of the blood-and-iron Bismarck, with his
strong jaw and pugnacious nose&mdash;the statesman militant
in uniform with a helmet over his bushy brow&mdash;who
had made the German Empire, that young empire
which had not yet known defeat because of the system
which makes ready and chooses the hour for its
blow.</p>

<p>Not far away one had glimpses of the white statues<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
of My Ancestors of the Sièges Allée, or avenue of
victory,&mdash;the present Kaiser’s own idea,&mdash;with the
great men of the time on their right and left hands.
People whose sense of taste, not to say of humour,
may limit their statecraft had smiled at this monotonous
and grandiose row of all the dead bones of distinguished
and mediocre royalty immortalised in marble
to the exact number of thirty-two. But they were
My Ancestors, O Germans, who made you what you
are! Right dress and keep that line of royalty in
mind! It is your royal line, older than the trees in
the garden, firm as the rocks, Germany itself. The
last is not the least in might nor the least advertised
in the age of publicity. He is to make the next step
in advance for Germany and bring more tribute home,
if all Germans will be loyal to him.</p>

<p>One paused to look at the photograph of the Kaiser
in a shop window; a big photograph of that man whose
photograph is everywhere in Germany. It is a stern
face, this face, as the leader wishes his people to see
him, with its erectile moustache, the lips firm set, the
eyes challenging and the chin held so as to make it
symbolic of strength: a face that strives to say in that
pose: “Onward! I lead!” Germans have seen it
every day for a quarter of a century. They have
lived with it and the character of it has grown into
their natures.</p>

<p>In the same window was a smaller photograph of the
Crown Prince, with his cap rakishly on the side of his
head, as if to give himself a distinctive characteristic
in the German eye; but his is the face of a man who
is not mature for his years and a trifle dissipated.
For a while after the war began he, as leader of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
war party, knew the joy of being more popular than
the Kaiser. But the tide turned soon in favour of a
father, who appeared to be drawn reluctantly into the
ordeal of death and wounds for his people in “defence
of the Fatherland,” and against a son who had clamoured
for the horror which his people had begun to
realise, particularly as his promised entry into Paris
had failed. There can be no question which of the
two has the wiser head.</p>

<p>The Crown Prince had passed into the background.
He was marooned with ennui in the face of the French
trenches in the West, while all the glory was being
won in the East. Indeed, father had put son in his
place. One day, the gossips said, son might have to
ask father, in the name of the Hohenzollerns, to help
him recover his popularity. His photograph had been
taken down from shop windows and in its place, on
the right hand of the Kaiser in the Sièges Allée of contemporary
fame, was the bull-dog face of von Hindenburg,
victor of Tannenberg. The Kaiser shared von
Hindenburg’s glory; he has shared the glory of all
victorious generals; such is his histrionic gift in the
age of the spotlight.</p>

<p>Make no mistake&mdash;his people, deluded or not, love
him not only because he is Kaiser but also for himself.
He is a clever man, who began his career with the
enormous capital of being emperor and made the most
of his position to amaze the world with a more versatile
and also a more inscrutable personality than most
people realise. Poseur, perhaps, but an emperor
these days may need to be a poseur in order to wear
the ermine of Divine Right convincingly to most of
his subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
His pose is always that of the anointed King of
My People. He has never given down on that point,
however much he has applied State Socialism to appease
the Socialistic agitation. He has personified
Germany and German ambition with an adroit egoism
and the sentiment of his inheritance. Those critics
who see the machinery of the throne may say that he
has the mind of a journalist, quick of perception, ready
of assimilation, knowing many things in their essentials
but no one thing thoroughly. But this is the kind of
mind that a ruler requires, plus the craft of the politician.</p>

<p>Is he a good man? Is he a great man? Banal
questions! He is the Kaiser on the background of the
Sièges Allée, who has first promoted himself, then the
Hohenzollerns, and then the interests of Germany
with all the zest of the foremost shareholder and
president of the corporation. No German in the German
hothouse of industry has worked harder than he.
He has kept himself up to the mark and tried to keep
his people up to the mark. It may be the wrong kind
of a mark; but we are not discussing that, and we may
beg leave to differ without threshing the old straw of
argument.</p>

<p>That young private I met in the grounds at Charlottenberg,
that wounded man helping with the harvest,
that tired hospital director, the small trader in
Hamburg, the sturdy Red Cross woman in the station
at Hanover, the peasants and the workers throughout
Germany, kept unimaginatively at their tasks, do not
see the machinery of the throne, only the man in the
photograph who supplies them with a national imagination.
His indefatigable goings and comings and his
poses fill their minds with a personality which typifies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
the national spirit. Will this change after the war?
But that, too, is not a subject for speculation here.</p>

<p>Through the war his pose has met the needs of the
hour. An emperor bowed down with the weight of
his people’s sacrifice, a grey, determined emperor
hastening to honour the victors, covering up defeats,
urging his legions on, himself at the front, never seen
by the general public in the rear, a mysterious figure,
not saying much and that foolish to the Allies but appealing
to the Germans, rather appearing to submerge
his own personality in the united patriotism of the
struggle&mdash;such is the picture which the throne machinery
has impressed on the German mind. The histrionic
gift may be at its best in creating a saga.</p>

<p>Always the offensive! Germany would keep on
striking as long as she had strength for a blow, while
making the pretence that she had the strength for still
heavier blows. One wonders, should she gain peace
by her blows, if the Allies would awaken after the
treaty was signed to find how near exhaustion she had
been, or that she was so self-contained in her production
of war material that she had only borrowed from
Hans to pay Fritz, who were both Germans. Russia
did not know how nearly she had Japan beaten until
after Portsmouth. Japan’s method was the German
method; she learned it from Germany.</p>

<p>At the end of my journey I was hearing the same
din of systematic optimism in my ears as in the beginning.</p>

<p>“Warsaw, then Paris, then our Zeppelins will finish
London,” said the restaurant keeper on the German
side of the Dutch frontier; “and our submarines
will settle the British navy before the summer is over.
No, the war will not last a year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
“And is America next on the programme?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“No. America is too strong; too far away.”</p>

<p>I was guilty of a faint suspicion that he was a
diplomatist.</p></div>

<span class="subhead">IN BELGIUM UNDER THE GERMANS</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>British hospitality to the Belgians&mdash;A Dutch refugee camp&mdash;The
American Commission for relief&mdash;Its generals&mdash;From Holland
to Belgium&mdash;A forlorn Landsturm guard&mdash;Life in a conquered
Land&mdash;The overlords in Antwerp&mdash;Belgium’s hatred&mdash;The
problem of feeding Belgium&mdash;American volunteers&mdash;“Some experience”&mdash;The
conqueror’s net&mdash;Relics of the former régime.</p></blockquote>

<p>No week at the front, where war is made, left the
mind so full as this week beyond the sound of the guns
with war’s results. It taught the meaning of the simple
words life and death, hunger and food, love and
hate. One was in a house with sealed doors, where
a family of seven millions sat in silence and idleness,
thinking of nothing but war and feeling nothing but
war. He had war cold as the fragments of a shrapnel
shell beside a dead man on a frozen road; war
analysed and docketed for exhibition, without its noise,
its distraction, and its hot passion.</p>

<p>In Ostend I had seen the Belgian refugees in flight
and I had seen them pouring into London stations,
bedraggled outcasts of every class, with the staring
uncertainty of the helpless human flock flying from the
storm. England, who considered that they had suffered
for her sake, opened her purse and her heart to
them; she opened her homes, both modest suburban
homes and big country houses which are particular
about their guests in time of peace. No British family
without a Belgian was doing its duty. Bishop’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
wife and publican’s wife took whatever Belgian was
sent to her. The refugee packet arrived without the
nature of contents on the address label. All Belgians
had become heroic and noble by grace of the defenders
of Liége.</p>

<p>Perhaps the bishop’s wife received a young woman
who smoked cigarettes and asked her hostess for rouge
and the publican’s wife received a countess. Mrs.
Smith of Clapham, who had brought up her children
in the strictest propriety, welcomed as playmates for
her dears, whom she had kept away from the contaminating
associations of the alleys, Belgian children from
the toughest quarters of Antwerp, who had a precocity
that led to baffling confusion in Mrs. Smith’s mind
between parental responsibility and patriotic duty.
Smart society gave the run of its houses sometimes to
gentry who were used to getting the run of that kind
of houses by lifting a window with a jimmy on a dark
night. It was a refugee lottery. When two hosts
met one said: “My Belgian is charming!” and the
other said: “Mine isn’t. Just listen&mdash;” But the
English are game; they are loyal; they bore their burden
of hospitality bravely.</p>

<p>The strange things that happened were not the
more agreeable because of the attitude of some refugees,
who when they were getting better fare than they
ever had at home, thought that, as they had given
their “all” for England, they should be getting still
better, not to mention wine on the table in temperance
families; while there was a disinclination toward self-support
by means of work on the part of certain heroes
which promised a Belgian occupation of England
that would last as long as the German occupation of
Belgium. England was learning that there are Belgians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
and Belgians. She had received not a few of
the “and Belgians.”</p>

<p>It was only natural. When the German cruisers
bombarded Scarborough and the Hartlepools, the first
to the station were not the finest and sturdiest. Those
with good bank accounts and a disinclination to take
any bodily or gastronomic risks, the young idler who
stands on the street corner ogling girls and the girls
who are always in the street to be ogled, the flighty-minded,
the irresponsible, the tramp, the selfish, and
the cowardly are bound to be in the van of flight from
any sudden disaster and to make the most of the generous
sympathy of those who succour them.</p>

<p>The courageous, the responsible, those with homes
and property at stake, those with an inborn sense of
real patriotism which means loyalty to locality and to
their neighbours, are more inclined to remain with
their homes and their property. Besides, a refugee
hardly appears at his best. He is in a strange country,
forlorn, homesick, a hostage of fate and personal
misfortune. The Belgian nation had taken the Allies’
side and now all individual Belgians expected the Allies
to help them.</p>

<p>England did not get the worst of the refugees.
They could travel no farther than Holland, where the
Dutch Government appropriated money to care for
them at the same time that it was under the expense
of keeping its army mobilised. Looking at the refugees
in the camp at Bergen op Zoom, an observer
might share some of the contempt of the Germans for
the Belgians. Crowded in temporary huts in the chill,
misty weather of a Dutch winter, they seemed listless,
marooned human wreckage. They would not dig
ditches to drain their camp; they were given to pilfering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
from one another the clothes which the world’s
charity supplied. The heart was out of them. They
were numbed by disaster.</p>

<p>“Are all these men and women who are living together
married?” I asked the Dutch officer in charge.</p>

<p>“It is not for us to inquire,” he replied. “Most
of them say that they have lost their marriage certificates.”</p>

<p>They were from the slums of that polyglot seaport
town Antwerp, which Belgians say is anything but real
Belgium. To judge Belgium by them is like judging
an American town by the worst of its back streets,
where saloons and pawnshops are numerous and the
red lights twinkle from dark doorways.</p>

<p>Around a table in a Rotterdam hotel one met some
generals, who were organising a different kind of campaign
from that which brought glory to the generals
who conquered Belgium. It was odd that Dr. Rose&mdash;that
Dr. Rose who had discovered and fought the
hook worm among the mountaineers of the Southern
States&mdash;should be succouring Belgium, and yet only
natural. Where else should he and Henry James, Jr.,
of the Rockefeller Foundation, and Mr. Bicknell, of
the American Red Cross, be, if not here directing the
use of an endowment fund set aside for just such purposes?</p>

<p>They had been all over Belgium and up into the
Northern departments of France occupied by the Germans,
investigating conditions. For they were practical
men, trained for solving the problem of charity
with wisdom, who wanted to know that their money
was well spent. They had nothing for the refugees
in London, but they found that the people who had
stayed at home in Belgium were worthy of help. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
fund was allowing five hundred thousand dollars a
month for the American Commission for Relief in
Belgium, which was the amount that the Germans had
spent in a single day in the destruction of the town
of Ypres with shells. Later they were to go to Poland;
then to Serbia.</p>

<p>With them was Herbert C. Hoover, a celebrated
mining engineer, the head of the Commission. When
American tourists were stranded over Europe at the
outset of the war, with letters of credit which could
not be cashed, their route homeward must lie through
London. They must have steamer passage. Hoover
took charge. When this work was done and Belgium
must be helped, he took charge of a task that
could be done only by a neutral. For the adjutants
and field officers of his force he turned to American
business men in London, to Rhodes scholars at Oxford,
and to other volunteers hastening from America.</p>

<p>When Harvard, 1914, who had lent a hand in the
American refugees’ trials, appeared in Hoover’s office
to volunteer for the new campaign, Hoover said:</p>

<p>“You are going to Rotterdam to-night.”</p>

<p>“So I am!” said Harvard, 1914, and started accordingly.
Action and not red tape must prevail in
such an organisation.</p>

<p>The Belgians whom I wished to see were those
behind the line of guards on the Belgo-Dutch frontier;
those who had remained at home under the Germans
to face humiliation and hunger. This was possible
if you had the right sort of influence and your
passport the right sort of visés to accompany a
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Besheinigung</i>, according to the form of “31 Oktober,
1914, Sect. 616, Nr. 1083,” signed by the German
consul at Rotterdam, which put me in the same automobile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
with Harvard, 1914, that stopped one blustery,
snowy day of late December before a gate, with Belgium
on one side and Holland on the other side of it
on the Rosendaal-Antwerp road.</p>

<p>“Once more!” said Harvard, 1914, who had made
this journey many times as a despatch rider.</p>

<p>One of the conquerors, the sentry representing the
majesty of German authority in Belgium, examined
the pass. The conqueror was a good deal larger
around the middle than when he was young, but not
so large as when he went to war. He had a scarf
tied over his ears under a cracked old patent leather
helmet, which the Saxon Landsturm must have taken
from their garrets when the Kaiser sent the old fellows
to keep the Belgians in order, so that the young
men could be spared to get rheumatism in the trenches
if they escaped death.</p>

<p>You could see that the conqueror missed his wife’s
cooking and Sunday afternoon in the beer garden with
his family. However much he loved the Kaiser, it
did not make him love home any the less. His nod
admitted us into German-ruled Belgium. He looked
so lonely that as our car started I sent him a smile.
Surprise broke on his face. Somebody not a German
in uniform had actually smiled at him in Belgium!
My last glimpse of him was of a grin spreading under
the scarf toward his ears.</p>

<p>Belgium was webbed with these old Landsturm
guards. If your <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Passerschein</i> was not right, you
might survive the first set of sentries and even the
second, but the third, and if not the third some succeeding
one of the dozens on the way to Brussels,
would hale you before a <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Kommandatur</i>. Then you
were in trouble. In travelling about Europe I became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
so used to passes that when I returned to New York
I could not have thought of going to Hoboken without
the German consul’s visa, or of dining at a French
restaurant without the French consul’s.</p>

<p>“And again!” said Harvard, 1914, as we came to
another sentry. There was good reason why Harvard
had his pass in a leather-bound case under a
celluloid face. Otherwise, it would soon have been
worn out in showing. He had been warned by the
Commission not to talk and he did not talk. He was
neutrality personified. All he did was to show his
pass. He could be silent in three languages. The
only time I got anything like partisanship out of him
and two sentences in succession was when I mentioned
the Harvard-Yale football game.</p>

<p>“My! Wasn’t that a smear! In their new stadium,
too! Oh, my! Wish I had been there!”</p>

<p>When the car broke a spring halfway to Antwerp,
he remarked, “Naturally!” or, rather, a more expressive
monosyllable which did not sound neutral.</p>

<p>While he and the Belgian chauffeur, with the help
of a Belgian farmer as spectator, were patching up
the broken spring, I had a look at the farm. The
winter crops were in; the cabbages and Brussels
sprouts in the garden were untouched. It happened
that the scorching finger of war’s destruction had not
been laid on this little property. In the yard the wife
was doing the week’s washing, her hands in hot water
and her arms exposed to weather so cold that I felt
none too warm in a heavy overcoat. At first sight she
gave me a frown, which instantly dissipated into a
smile when she saw that I was not German.</p>

<p>If not German, I must be a friend. Yet if I were
I would not dare talk&mdash;not with German sentries all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
about. She lifted her hand from the suds and swung
it out to the west toward England and France with an
eager, craving fire in her eyes, and then she swept it
across in front of her as if she were sweeping a spider
off a table. When it stopped at arm’s length there
was the triumph of hate in her eyes. I thought of
the lid of a cauldron raised to let out a burst of steam
as she asked: “When?” When? When would
the Allies come and turn the Germans out?</p>

<p>She was a kind, hard-working woman, who would
help any stranger in trouble the best she knew how.
Probably that Saxon whose smile had spread under his
scarf had much the same kind of wife. Yet I knew
that if the Allies’ guns were driving the Germans
past her house and her husband had a rifle, he would
put a shot in that Saxon’s back, or she would pour
boiling water on the enemy’s head if she could. Then,
if the Germans had time, they would burn the farmhouse
and kill the husband who had shot one of their
comrades.</p>

<p>I recollect a youth who had been in a railroad accident
saying: “That was the first time I had ever
seen death; the first time I realised what death was.”
Exactly. You don’t know death till you have seen it;
you don’t know invasion till you have felt it. However
wise, however able the conquerors, life under
them is a living death. True, the farmer’s property
was untouched. But his liberty was gone. If you, a
well-behaved citizen, have ever been arrested and
marched through the streets of your home town by a
policeman, how did you like it? Give the policeman
a rifle and a fixed bayonet and full cartridge boxes
and transform him into a foreigner and the experience
would not be any more pleasant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
That farmer could not go to the next town without
the permission of the sentries. He could not
even mail a letter to his son who was in the trenches
with the Allies. The Germans had taken his horse;
theirs the power to take anything he had&mdash;the power
of the bayonet. If he wanted to send his produce to
a foreign market, if he wanted to buy food in a foreign
market, the British naval blockade closed the sea
to him. He was sitting on a chair of steel spikes,
hands tied and mouth gagged, while his mind seethed,
solacing its hate with hope through the long winter
months. If you lived in Kansas and could not get
your wheat to Chicago, or any groceries or newspapers
from the nearest town, or learn whether your son in
Wyoming were alive or dead, or whether the man who
owned your mortgage in New York had foreclosed or
not&mdash;well, that is enough without the German sentry.</p>

<p>Only, instead of newspapers or word about the
mortgage, the thing you needed past that blockade was
bread to keep you from starving. America opened
a window and slipped a loaf into the empty larder.
Those Belgian soldiers whom I had seen at Dixmude,
wounded, exhausted, mud-caked, shivering, were
happy beside the people at home. They were in the
fight. It is not the destruction of towns and houses
that impresses you most, but the misery expressed
by that peasant woman over her washtub.</p>

<p>A writer can make a lot of the burst of a single
shell; a photographer showing the ruins of a block
of buildings or a church makes it appear that all
blocks and all churches are in ruins. Running through
Antwerp in a car, one saw few signs of destruction
from the bombardment. You will see them if you are
specially conducted. Shops were open, the people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
were moving about in the streets, which were well
lighted. No need of darkness for fear of bombs
dropping here! German barracks had safe shelter
from aerial raids in a city whose people were the
allies of England and France. But at intervals
marched the German patrols.</p>

<p>When our car stopped before a restaurant a knot
gathered around it. Their faces were like all the
other faces I saw in Belgium&mdash;unless German&mdash;with
that restrained, drawn look of passive resistance,
persistent even when they smiled. When?
When were the Allies coming? Their eyes asked the
question which their tongues dared not. Inside the
restaurant a score of German officers served by Belgian
waiters were dining. Who were our little party?
What were we doing there and speaking English&mdash;English,
the hateful language of the hated enemy?
Oh, yes! We were Americans connected with the relief
work. But between the officers’ stares at the
sound of English and the appealing inquiry of the
faces in the street lay an abyss of war’s fierce suspicion
and national policies and racial enmity, which
America had to bridge.</p>

<p>Before we could help Belgium, England, blockading
Germany to keep her from getting foodstuffs, had
to consent. She would consent only if none of the
food reached German mouths. Germany had to
agree not to requisition any of the food. Some one
not German and not British must see to its distribution.
Those rigid German military authorities, holding
fast to their military secrets, must consent to scores
of foreigners moving about Belgium and sending messages
across that Belgo-Dutch frontier, which had been
closed to all except official German messages. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
called for men whom both the German and the British
duellists would trust to succour the human beings
crouched and helpless under the circling flashes of
their steel.</p>

<p>Fortunately, our Minister to Belgium was Brand
Whitlock. He is no Talleyrand or Metternich. If
he were, the Belgians might not have been fed, because
he might have been suspected of being too much
of a diplomatist. When a German, or an Englishman,
or a Hottentot, or any other kind of a human
being gets to know Whitlock, he recognises that here
is an honest man with a big heart. When leading
Belgians came to him and said that winter would find
Belgium without bread, he turned from the land that
has the least food to his own land, which has the
most.</p>

<p>For Belgium is a great shop in the midst of a garden.
Her towns are so close together that they seem
only suburbs of Brussels and Antwerp. She has the
densest population in Europe. She raises only enough
food to last her for two months of the year. The
food for the other ten months she buys with the products
of her factories. In 1914–15 Belgium could not
send out her products; so we were to help feed her
without pay, and England and France were to give
money to buy what food we did not give.</p>

<p>But with the British navy generously allowing food
to pass the blockade, the problem was far from solved.
Ships laden with supplies steaming to Rotterdam&mdash;this
was a matter of easy organisation. How get
the bread to the hungry mouths when the Germans
were using all Belgian railroads for military purposes?
Germany was not inclined to allow a carload
of wheat to keep a carload of soldiers from reaching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
the front, or to let food for Belgians keep the men in
the trenches from getting theirs regularly. Horse
and cart transport would be cumbersome, and the Germans
would not permit Belgian teamsters to move
about with such freedom. As likely as not they might
be spies.</p>

<p>Anybody who can walk or ride may be a spy.
Therefore, the way to stop spying is not to let any one
walk or ride. Besides, Germany had requisitioned
most of the horses that could do more than draw an
empty phaeton on a level. But she had not drawn
the water out of the canals; though the Belgians, always
whispering jokes at the expense of the conquerors,
said that the canals might have been emptied if
their contents had been beer. There were plenty of
idle boats in Holland, whose canals connect with the
web of canals in Belgium. You had only to seal the
cargoes against requisition, the seal to be broken only
by a representative of the Relief Commission, and
start them to their destination.</p>

<p>And how make sure that only those who had money
should pay for their bread, while all who had not
should be reached? The solution was simple compared
to the distribution of relief after the San Francisco
earthquake and fire, for example, in our own
land, where a scantier population makes social organisation
comparatively loose.</p>

<p>The people to be relieved were in their homes.
Belgium is so old a country, her population so dense,
and she is so much like one big workshop, that the
Government must keep a complete set of books.
Every Belgian is registered and docketed. You know
just how he makes his living and where he lives.
Upon marriage a Belgian gets a little book, giving his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
name and his wife’s, their ages, their occupations, and
address. As children are born their names are added.
A Belgian holds as fast to this book as a woman to a
piece of jewellery that is an heirloom.</p>

<p>With few exceptions, Belgian local officials had not
fled the country. They realised that this was a time
when they were particularly needed on the job to protect
the people from German exactions and from their
own rashness. There were also any number of volunteers.
The thing was to get the food to them and
let them organise local distribution.</p>

<p>The small force of Americans required to oversee
the transit must both watch that the Germans did not
take any of the food and retain both British and German
confidence in the absolute good faith of their intentions.
The volunteers got their expenses and the
rest of their reward was experience; and it was “some
experience” as a Belgian said, who was learning a
little American slang. They talked about canal-boat
cargoes as if they had been from Buffalo to Albany on
the Erie Canal for years; they spoke of “my province”
and compared bread lines and the efficiency of
local officials. And the Germans took none of the
food; orders from Berlin were obeyed. Berlin knew
that any requisitioning of relief supplies meant that
the Relief Commission would cease work and announce
to the world the reason.</p>

<p>However many times the Americans were arrested
they must be patient. That exception who said, when
he was put in a cell overnight because he entered the
military zone by mistake, that he would not have
been treated that way in England, needed a little more
coaching in preserving his mask of neutrality. For I
must say that nine out of ten of these young men,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
leaning over backward to be neutral, were pro-Ally,
including some with German names. But publicly
you could hardly get an admission out of them that
there was any war. As for Harvard, 1914, hand a
passport carried around the Sphinx’s neck and you
have him done in stone.</p>

<p>Fancy any Belgian trying to get him to carry a
contraband letter or a German commander trying to
work him for a few sacks of flour! When I asked
him what career he had chosen he said, “Business!”
without any waste of words. I think that he will succeed
in a way to surprise his family. It is he and all
those young Americans of which he is a type, as distinctive
of America in manner, looks, and thought as
a Frenchman is of France or a German of Germany,
who carried the torch of Peace’s kindly work into
war-ridden Belgium. They made you want to tickle
the eagle on the throat so he would let out a gentle,
well-modulated scream, of course, strictly in keeping
with neutrality.</p>

<p>Red lanterns took the place of red flags swung by
Landsturm sentries on the run to Brussels as darkness
fell. There was no relaxation of watchfulness
at night. All the twenty-four hours the systematic
conquerors held the net tight. Once when my companion
repeated his “Again!” and held out the pass
in the lantern’s rays, I broke into a laugh, which excited
his curiosity, for you soon get out of the habit
of laughing in Belgium.</p>

<p>“It has just occurred to me that my guidebook
states that passports are not required in Belgium!” I
explained.</p>

<p>The editor of that guidebook will have a busy time
before he issues the next edition. For example, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
will have a lot of new information about Malines,
whose ruins were revealed by the motor lamps in
shadowy, broken walls on either side of the main
street. Other places where less damage had been
done were equally silent. In the smaller towns and
villages the population must keep indoors at night;
for egress and ingress are more difficult to control
there than in large cities, where guards at every
corner suffice&mdash;watching, watching, these disciplined
pawns of remorselessly efficient militarism; watching
every human being in Belgium.</p>

<p>“The last time I saw that statue of Liége,” I remarked,
peering into the darkness as we rode into the
city, “the Legion of Honour conferred by France on
Liége for its brave defence was hung on its breast. I
suppose it is gone now.”</p>

<p>“I guess yes,” said Harvard, 1914.</p>

<p>We went to the hotel at Brussels which I had left
the day before the city’s fall. English railway signs
on the walls of the corridor had not been disturbed.
More ancient relic still seemed a bulletin board with
its announcement of seven passages a day to England,
traversing the Channel in “fifty-five minutes <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">via</i> Calais”
and “three hours <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">via</i> Ostend,” with the space
blank where the state of the weather for the despair
or the delight of intending voyagers had been chalked
up in happier days. The same men were in attendance
at the office as before; but they seemed older and
their politeness that of cheerless automatons. For
five months they had been serving German officers as
guests with hate in their hearts and, in turn, trying to
protect their property.</p>

<p>A story is told of how that hotel had filled with
officers after the arrival of the Germanic flood and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
how one day, when it was learned that the proprietor
was a Frenchman, guards were suddenly placed at
the doors and the hall was filled with baggage as every
officer, acting with characteristic official solidarity, vacated
his room and bestowed his presence elsewhere.
Then the proprietor was informed that his guests
would return if he would agree to employ German
help and buy his supplies from Germany. He refused,
for practical as well as for sentimental reasons.
If he had consented, think what the Belgians would
have done to him after the Germans were gone!
However, officers were gradually returning, for this
was the best hotel in town, and even conquerors are
human and German conquerors have particularly human
stomachs.</p></div>

<span class="subhead">CHRISTMAS IN BELGIUM</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>“A man’s house is his castle” worth fighting for&mdash;Breakfast in a
Belgian hotel&mdash;Groups of the conquerors&mdash;“News” in Belgium&mdash;Companionship
at mass&mdash;Business at a standstill&mdash;A Belgian
bread line&mdash;Workers and no work&mdash;Methods of relief
distribution&mdash;German surveillance&mdash;Dinner at the American
legation&mdash;“When would the Allies come?”</p></blockquote>

<p>Christmas in Belgium with the bayonet and the wolf
at the door taught one to value Christmas at home for
more than its gifts and the cheer of the fireside. It
taught him what it meant to belong to a free people
and how precious is that old England saying that a
man’s house is his castle, which was the inception of
so much in our lives that we accept as a commonplace.
If such a commonplace can be made secure only by
fighting, then it is best to fight. At any time a foreign
soldier might enter the house of a Belgian and take
him away for trial before a military court.</p>

<p>Breakfast in the same restaurant as before the city’s
fall! Again the big grapes which are a luxury of
the rich man’s table or an extravagance for a sick
friend with us! The hothouses still grew them.
What else was there for the hothouses to do, though
the export of their products was impossible? A shortage
of the long, white-leafed chicory that we call endive
in New York restaurants! There were piles of
it in the Brussels market and on the hucksters’ carts;
nothing so cheap. One might have excellent steaks
and roasts and delicious veal; for the heifers were being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
butchered, as the Germans had taken all fodder.
But the bread was the Commission’s brown, which
every one had to eat. Belgium, growing quality on
scanty acres with intensive farming, had food luxuries
but not the staff of life.</p>

<p>One looked out of the windows on to the square
which four months before he had seen crowded with
people bedecked with the Allies’ colours and eagerly
buying the latest editions containing the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">communiqués</i>
of hollow optimism. No flag in sight now except a
German flag flying over the station! But small revenges
may be enjoyed. A German soldier tried to
jump on the tail of a cart driven by a Belgian; but
the Belgian whipped up his horse and the German fell
off onto the pavement, while the cart sped around a
corner.</p>

<p>Out of the station came a score of German soldiers
returning from the trenches, on their way to barracks
to regain strength so that they could bear the ordeal
of standing in icy water again. They were not the
kind exhibited on press tours to illustrate the “vigour
of our indomitable army.” Eyelids drooped over
hollow eye-sockets; sore, numbed feet moved like feet
which are asleep in their vain effort to keep step.
Sensitiveness to surroundings, almost to existence,
seemed to have been lost.</p>

<p>One was a corporal, young, tall, and full-bearded.
He might have been handsome if he had not been so
haggard. He gave the lead to the others; he seemed
to know where they were going, and they shuffled on
after him in dogged painfulness. Four months ago
that corporal, with the spring of the energy of youth
when the war was young, was perhaps in the green
column that went through the streets of Brussels in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
thunderous beat of their regular tread on the way to
Paris. The group was an object lesson in how much
the victor must suffer in war in order to make his victim
suffer.</p>

<p>Some officers were at breakfast, too. Mostly they
were reservists; mostly bespectacled, with middle age
swelling their girth and hollowing their chests, but
sturdy enough to apply the regulations made for conduct
of the conquered. While stronger men were
under shell-fire at the front, they were under the fire
of Belgian hate as relentless as their own hate of England.
You saw them always in the good restaurants,
but never in the company of Belgians, these ostracised
rulers. In four months they had made no friends; at
least, no friends who would appear with them in public.
A few thousand guards in Belgium in the companionship
of conquest and seven million Belgians in
the companionship of a common helplessness! Bayonets
may make a man silent, but they cannot stop his
thinking.</p>

<p>At the breakfast table on that Christmas morning
in London, Paris, or Berlin the patriot could find the
kind of news that he liked. His racial and national
predilections and animosities were solaced. If there
were good news it was “played up”; if there were
bad news, it was not published, or it was explained.
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">L’Écho Belge</i> and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">L’Indépendence Belge</i>, and all the
Brussels papers were either out of business or being
issued as single sheets in Holland and England.</p>

<p>The Belgian, keenest of all the peoples at war for
news, having less occupation to keep his mind off the
war, must read the newspapers established under German
auspices, which fed him with the pabulum that
German <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chefs</i> provided, reflective of the stumbling degeneracy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
of England, French weariness of the war,
Russian clumsiness, and the invincibility of Germany.
If an Englishman had to read German, or a German
English, newspapers every morning he might have
understood how the Belgian felt.</p>

<p>Those who had sons or fathers or husbands in the
Belgian army could not send or receive letters, let
alone presents. Families scattered in different parts
of Belgium could not hold reunions. But at mass I
saw a Belgian standard in the centre of the church.
That flag was proscribed, but the priests knew it was
safe in that sacred place and the worshippers might
feast their eyes on it as they said their <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">aves</i>.</p>

<p>A Bavarian soldier came in softly and stood a little
apart from others, many in mourning, at the rear, a
man who was of the same faith as the Belgians and
who crossed himself with the others in the house of
brotherly love. He would go outside to obey orders;
and the others to nurse their hate of him and his race.
This private in his faded green, bowing his head before
that flag in the shadows of the nave, was war-sick,
as most soldiers were; and the Belgians were
heartsick. They had the one solace in common. But
if you had suggested to him to give up Belgium, his
answer would have been that of the other Germans:
“Not after all we have suffered to take it!” Christians
have a peculiar way of applying Christianity.
Yet if it were not for Christianity and that infernal
thing called the world’s opinion, which did not exist
in the days of Cæsar and the Belgii, the Belgians
might have been worse off than they were. More of
them might have been dead. When they were saying,
“Give us this day our daily bread” they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
thinking, “An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,”
if ever their turn came.</p>

<p>A satirist might have repeated the apocryphal
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">naïveté</i> of Marie Antoinette, who asked why the people
wanted bread when they could buy such nice cakes
for a sou. For all the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">patisseries</i> were open. Brussels
is famous for its French pastry. With a store of
preserves, why shouldn’t the bakeshops go on making
tarts with heavy crusts of the brown flour, when war
had not robbed the bakers of their art? It gave work
to them; it helped the shops to keep open and make
a show of normality. But I noticed that they were
doing little business. Stocks were small and bravely
displayed. Only the rich could afford such luxuries,
which in ordinary times were what ice cream cones
are to us. Even the jewellery shops were open, with
diamond rings flashing in the windows.</p>

<p>“You must pay rent; you don’t want to discharge
your employees,” said a jeweller. “There is no place
to go except your shop. If you closed it would look
as if you were afraid of the Germans. It would
make you blue and the people in the street blue. One
tries to go through the motions of normal existence,
anyway. But, of course, you don’t sell anything.
This week I have repaired a locket which carried the
portrait of a soldier at the front and I’ve put a mainspring
in a watch. I’ll warrant that is more than some
of my competitors have done.”</p>

<p>Swing around the circle in Brussels of a winter’s
morning and look at the only crowds that the Germans
allow to gather, and any doubt that Belgium would
have gone hungry if she had not received provisions
from the outside was dispelled. Whenever I think of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
a bread line again I shall see the faces of a Belgian
bread line. They blot out the memory of those at
home, where men are free to go and come; where war
has not robbed the thrifty of food.</p>

<p>It was fitting that the great central soup kitchen
should be established in the central express office of
the city. For in Belgium these days there is no express
business except in German troops to the front
and wounded to the rear. The despatch of parcels is
stopped, no less than the other channels of trade, in a
country where trade was so rife, a country that lived
by trade. On the stone floor, where once packages
were arranged for forwarding to the towns whose
names are on the walls, were many great cauldrons in
clusters of three, to economise space and fuel.</p>

<p>“We don’t lack cooks,” said a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chef</i>, who had been in
a leading hotel. “So many of us are out of work.
Our society of hotel and restaurant keepers took
charge. We know the practical side of the business.
I suppose you have the same kind of a society in New
York and would turn to it for help if the Germans occupied
New York.”</p>

<p>He gave me a printed report in which I read, for example,
that “M. Arndt, professor of the École Normale,
had been good enough to take charge of accounts,”
and “M. Catteau had been specially appointed
to look after the distribution of bread.”</p>

<p>Most appetising that soup prepared under direction
of the best <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chefs</i> in the city. The meat and green
vegetables in it were Belgian and the peas American.
Steaming hot in big cans it was sent to the communal
centres, where lines of people with pots, pitchers, and
pails waited to receive their daily allowance. A democracy
was in that bread line such as I have never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
seen anywhere except at San Francisco after the earthquake.
Each person had a blue or a yellow ticket,
with numbers to be punched, like a commuter. The
blue tickets were for those who had proved to the communal
authorities that they could not pay; the yellow
for those who paid five centimes for each person
served. A flutter of blue and yellow tickets all over
Belgium, and in return life! With each serving of
soup went a loaf of the American brown bread. The
faces in the line were not those of people starving&mdash;they
had been saved from starvation. There was
none of the emaciation which pictures of famine in the
Orient have made familiar; but they were pinched
faces, bloodless faces, the faces of people on short rations.</p>

<p>To the Belgian bread is not only the staff of life; it
is the legs. At home we think of bread as something
that goes with the rest of the meal; to the poorer
classes of Belgians the rest of the meal is something
that goes with bread. To you and me food has meant
the payment of money to the baker and the butcher and
the grocer, or the hotelkeeper. You get your money
by work or from investments. What if there were no
bread to be had for work or money? Sitting on a
mountain of gold in the desert of Sahara would not
quench thirst.</p>

<p>Three hundred grams, a minimum calculation&mdash;about
half what the British soldier gets&mdash;was the
ration. That small boy sent by his mother got five
loaves; his ticket called for an allowance for a family
of five. An old woman got one loaf, for she was
alone in the world. Each one as he hurried by had a
personal story of what war had meant to him. They
answered your questions frankly, gladly, with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
Belgian cheerfulness which was amazing considering
the circumstances. A tall, distinguished-looking man
was an artist.</p>

<p>“No work for artists these days,” he said.</p>

<p>No work in a community of workers where every
link of the chain of economic life had been broken.
No work for the next man, a chauffeur, or the next, a
brass worker; the next, a teamster; the next, a bank
clerk; the next, a doorkeeper of a Government office;
while the wives of those who still had work were buying
in the only market they had. But the husbands of
some were not at home. Each answer about the
absent one had an appeal that nothing can picture better
than the simple words or the looks that accompanied
the words.</p>

<p>“The last I heard of my husband he was fighting at
Dixmude&mdash;two months ago.”</p>

<p>“Mine is wounded, somewhere in France.”</p>

<p>“Mine was with the army, too. I don’t know
whether he is alive or dead. I have not heard since
Brussels was taken. He cannot get my letters and I
cannot get his.”</p>

<p>“Mine was killed at Liége, but we have a son.”</p>

<p>So you out in Nebraska who gave a handful of
wheat might know that said handful of wheat reached
its destination in an empty stomach. If you sent a suit
of clothes or a cap or a pair of socks, come along to the
skating-rink, where ice polo was played and matches
and carnivals were held in better days, and look on at
the boxes, packed tight with gifts of every manner of
thing that men and women and children wear except
silk hats, which are being opened and sorted and distributed
into hastily constructed cribs and compartments.</p>

A Belgian woman whose father was one of Belgium’s
leading lawyers&mdash;her husband was at the
front&mdash;was the busy head of this organisation, because,
as she said, the busier she was the more it
“keeps my mind off&mdash;” and she did not finish the sentence.
How many times I heard that “keeps my mind
off&mdash;” a sentence that was the more telling for not
being finished. She and some other women began
sewing and patching and collecting garments; “but
our business grew so fast”&mdash;the business of relief is
the one kind in Belgium that does grow these days&mdash;“that
now we have hundreds of helpers. I begin to
feel that I am what you would call in America a captainess
of industry.”</p>

<p>Some of the good mothers in America were a little
too thoughtful in their kindness. An odour in a box
that had evidently travelled across the Atlantic close
to the ship’s boilers was traced to the pocket of a boy’s
suit, which contained the hardly distinguishable remains
of a ham sandwich, meant to be ready to hand
for the hungry Belgian boy who got that suit. Broken
pots of jam were quite frequent. But no matter.
Soap and water and Belgian industry saved the suit,
if not the sandwich. Sweaters and underclothes and
overcoats almost new and shiny, old frock coats and
trousers with holes in seat and knees might represent
equal sacrifice on the part of some American three
thousand miles away, and all were welcome. Needle-women
were given work cutting up the worn-outs of
grown-ups and making them over into astonishingly
good suits or dresses for youngsters.</p>

<p>“We’ve really turned the rink into a kind of department
store,” said the lady. “Come into our boot
department. We had some leather left in Belgium<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
that the Germans did not requisition, so we bought it
and that gave more Belgians work in the shoe factories.
Work, you see, is what we want to keep
our minds off&mdash;”</p>

<p>Blue and yellow tickets here, too! Boots for children
and thick-set working women and watery-eyed old
men! And each was required to leave behind the pair
he was wearing.</p>

<p>“Sometimes we can patch up the cast-offs, which
means work for the cobblers,” said the captainess of
industry. “And who are our clerks? Why, the
people who put on the skates for the patrons of the
rink, of course!”</p>

<p>One could write volumes on this systematic relief
work, the businesslike industry of succouring Belgium
by the businesslike Belgians, with American help.
Certainly one cannot leave out those old men stragglers
from Louvain and Bruges and Ghent&mdash;venerable
children with no offspring to give them paternal
care&mdash;who took their turn in getting bread, which
they soaked thoroughly in their soup for reasons that
would be no military secret, not even in the military
zone. On Christmas Day an American, himself a
smoker, thinking what class of children he could make
happiest on a limited purse, remembered the ring
around the stove and bought a basket of cheap briar
pipes and tobacco. By Christmas night some toothless
gums were sore, but a beatific smile of satiation
played in white beards.</p>

<p>Nor can one leave out the very young babies at
home, who get their milk if grown people don’t, and
the older babies beyond milk but not yet old enough
for bread and meat, whose mothers return from the
bread line to bring their children to another line, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
they got portions of a sirupy mixture which those who
know say is the right provender. On such occasions
men are quite helpless. They can only look on with
a frog in the throat at pale, improperly nourished
mothers with bundles of potential manhood and
womanhood in their arms. For this was woman’s
work for woman. Belgian women of every class
joined in it: the competent wife of a workman, or the
wife of a millionaire who had to walk like everybody
else now that her automobile was requisitioned by the
army.</p>

<p>Pop-eyed children, ruddy-cheeked, aggressive children,
pinched-faced children, kept warm by sweaters
that some American or English children spared, happy
in that they did not know what their elders knew! Not
the danger of physical starvation so much as the actual
presence of mental starvation was the thing that got
on our nerves in a land where the sun is seldom seen
in winter and rainy days are the rule. It was bad
enough in the “zone of occupation,” so called, a line
running from Antwerp past Brussels to Mons. One
could guess what it was like in the military zone to the
westward, where only an occasional American relief
representative might go.</p>

<p>This is not saying that the Germans were stricter
than necessary, if we excuse the exasperation of their
militarism, in order to prevent information from passing
out when a multitude of Belgians would have risked
their lives gladly to help the Allies. One spy bringing
accurate information might cost the German army
thousands of casualties; perhaps decide the fate of a
campaign. They saw the Belgians as enemies. They
were fighting to take the lives of their enemies and save
their own lives, which made it tough for them and for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
the French and the British&mdash;tough all round, but very
particularly tough for Belgians.</p>

<p>It was good for a vagrant American to dine at the
American Legation, where Mr. and Mrs. Whitlock
were far, very far, from the days in Toledo, Ohio,
where he was mayor. Some said that the place of the
Minister to Belgium was at Havre, where the Belgian
Government had its offices; but neither Whitlock nor
the Belgian people thought so, nor the German Government,
of late, since they had realised his prestige
with the Belgians and how they would listen to him in
any crisis when their passions might break the bonds
of wisdom. Hugh Gibson, being the omnipresent Secretary
of Legation in four languages, naturally was
also present. We recalled dining together in Honduras,
when he was in the thick of vexations.</p>

<p>Trouble accommodatingly waits for him wherever
he goes, because he has a gift for taking care of
trouble, in the ascendency of a cheerful spirit and much
knowledge of international law. His present for the
Minister who daily received stacks of letters from all
sources asking the impossible, as well as from Americans
who wanted to be sure that the food they gave
was not being purloined by the Germans, was a rubber
stamp, “Blame-it-all&mdash;there’s-a-state-of-war-in-Belgium!”
which he suggested might save typewriting&mdash;a
recommendation which the Minister refused to accept,
not to Gibson’s surprise.</p>

<p>On that Christmas afternoon and evening, the
people promenaded the streets as usual. You might
have thought it a characteristic Christmas afternoon
or evening except for the Landsturm patrols. But
there was an absence of the old gaiety, and they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
moving as if from habit and moving was all there was
to do.</p>

<p>They had heard the sound of the guns at Dixmude
the night before. Didn’t the sound seem a little
nearer? No. The wind from that direction was
stronger. When? When would the Allies come?</p></div>

<span class="subhead">THE FUTURE OF BELGIUM</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>A buffer state divided in itself&mdash;Her ideals those of prosperity&mdash;False
sentiment regarding the Belgians&mdash;Not a war-like people&mdash;Moral
force of her plutocracy&mdash;Ruins exaggerated&mdash;German
policy of destruction&mdash;“Mass” logic&mdash;A military occupancy,
merciless and crafty&mdash;“Reprisals” of the Belgians&mdash;Louvain&mdash;The
bread line at Liége&mdash;Politics and German propaganda&mdash;Her
Belgian policy worthy of England at her best&mdash;England
still true to her ideals.</p></blockquote>

<p>In former days the traveller hardly thought of Belgium
as possessing patriotic homogeneity. It was a
land of two languages, French and Flemish. He was
puzzled to meet people who looked like well-to-do
mechanics, artisans, or peasants and find that they
could not answer a simple question in French. This
explained why a people so close to France, though they
made Brussels a little Paris, would not join the French
family and enter into the spirit and body of that great
civilisation on their borders, whose language was that
of their own literature. Belgium seemed to have no
character. Its nationality was the artificial product of
European politics; a buffer divided in itself, which
would be neither French nor German nor definitely
Belgian.</p>

<p>In later times Belgium had prospered enormously.
It had developed the resources of the Congo in a way
that had aroused a storm of criticism. Old King Leopold
made the most of his neutral position to gain advantages
which no one of the great powers might enjoy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
because of jealousies. The International Sleeping-Car
Company was Belgian and Belgian capitalists secured
concessions here and there, wherever the small
tradesman might slip into openings suitable to his size.
Leopold was not above crumbs; he made them profitable.
Leopold liked to make money and Belgium
liked to make money.</p>

<p>Her defence guaranteed by neutrality, Belgium need
have no thought except of thrift. Her ideals were
those of prosperity. No ambition of national expansion
stirred her imagination as Germany’s was stirred;
there was no fire in her soul as in that of France in
apprehension of the day when she should have to fight
for her life against Germany; no national cause to
harden the sinews of patriotism. The immensity of
her urban population contributed its effect in depriving
her of the sterner stuff of which warriors are made.
Success meant more comforts and luxuries. In towns
like Brussels and Antwerp this doubtless had its effect
on the moralities, which were hardly of the New
England Puritan standard. She had a small standing
army; a militia system in the process of reform against
the conviction of the majority, unlike that of the Swiss
mountaineers, that Belgium would never have any need
for soldiers.</p>

<p>If militarism means conscription as it exists in
France and Germany, then militarism has improved
the physique of races in an age when people are leaving
the land for the factory. The prospect of battle’s
test unquestionably developed certain sturdy qualities
in a people which can and ought to be developed in
some other way than with the prospect of spending
money for shells to kill other people.</p>

<p>With the world making every Belgian man a hero<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
and the unknowing convinced that a citizen soldiery
at Liége&mdash;defended by the Belgian standing army&mdash;had
rushed from their homes with rifles and beaten
German infantry, it is right to repeat that the <i xml:lang="be" lang="be">shipperke</i>
spirit was not universal, that at no time had
Belgium more than a hundred and fifty thousand men
under arms, and that on the Dixmude line she maintained
never more than eighty thousand men out of a
population of seven millions, which should yield from
seven hundred thousand to a million; while they lost a
good deal of sympathy both in England and in France
through the number of able-bodied refugees who were
disinclined to serve. It was a mistaken idealism that
swept over the world early in the war, characterising
a whole nation with the gallantry of its young king and
his little army.</p>

<p>The spirit of the Boers or of the Minute Men at
Lexington was not in the Belgian people. It could not
be from their very situation and method of life. They
did not believe in war; they did not expect to practice
war; but war came to them out of the still
blue heavens, as it came to the prosperous Incas of
Peru.</p>

<p>Where one was wrong was in his expectation that
her bankers and capitalists&mdash;an aristocracy of money
not given to the simple life&mdash;and her manufacturers,
artisans, and traders, if not her peasants, would soon
make truce with Cæsar for individual profit. Therein,
Belgium showed that she was not lacking in the moral
spirit which, with the <i xml:lang="be" lang="be">shipperke’s</i>, became a fighting
spirit. It seemed as if the metal of many Belgians,
struck to a white heat in the furnace of war, had cooled
under German occupation to the tempered steel of a
new nationalism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
When you travelled over Belgium after it was
pacified, the logic of German methods became clear.
What was haphazard in their reign of terror was due
to the inevitable excesses of a soldiery taking the calculated
redress ordered by superiors as licence in the first
red passion of war to a war-mad nation, which was
sullen because the Belgians had not given up the keys
of the gate to France.</p>

<p>The extent of the ruins in Belgium east of the Yser
has been exaggerated. They were the first ruins, most
photographed, most advertised; bad enough, inexcusable
enough, and warrantedly causing a spell of horror
throughout the civilised world. We have heard all
about them, mind, while hearing nothing about those in
Lorraine, where the Bavarians exceeded Prussian ruthlessness
in reprisals. I mean, that to have read the
newspapers in early September, 1914, one would have
thought that half the towns of Belgium were <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débris</i>,
while the truth is that only a small percentage are&mdash;those
in the path of the German army’s advance.
Two-thirds of Louvain itself is unharmed; though the
fact alone of its venerable library being in ashes is
sufficient outrage, if not another building had been
harmed.</p>

<p>The German army planned destruction with all the
regularity that it billeted troops, or requisitioned supplies,
or laid war indemnities. It did not destroy by
shells exclusively. It deliberately burned homes.
No matter whether the owners were innocent or not,
the homes were burned as an example. The principle
applied was that of punishing half a dozen or all
the boys in the class in the hope of getting the real
culprit.</p>

<p>Cold ruins mark blocks where sniping was thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
to have occurred. The Germans insist that theirs was
the merciful way. <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Krieg ist Krieg.</i> When a hundred
citizens of Louvain were gathered and shot because
they were the first citizens of Louvain to hand, the purpose
was security of the mass at the expense of the
individual, according to the war-is-war machine reasoning.
No doubt there was firing on German troops by
civilians. What did the Germans expect after the way
that they had invaded Belgium? If they had bothered
with trials and investigations, the conquerors say,
sniping would have kept up. They may have taken
innocent lives and burned the homes of the innocent,
they admit; but their defence is that thereby they saved
many thousands of their soldiers and of Belgians, and
prevented the feud between the rulers and the ruled
from becoming more embittered.</p>

<p>Sniping over, the next step in policy was to keep the
population quiet with the minimum of soldiery, which
would permit a maximum at the front. In a thickly-settled
country, so easily policed, in a land with the
population inured to peace, the wisdom of keeping
quiet was soon evident to the people. What if Boers
had been in the Belgians’ place? Would they have
attempted guerrilla warfare? Would you or I want
to bring destruction on neighbours in a land without
any rural fastnesses as a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rendezvous</i> for operations?
One could tell only if a section of our country were
invaded.</p>

<p>A burned block costs less than a dead German
soldier. The system was efficacious. It was mercilessness
mixed with craft. When Prussian brusqueness
was found to be unnecessarily irritating to the population,
causing rash Belgians to turn desperate, the
elders of the Saxon and Bavarian co-religionists were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
called in. They were amiable fathers of families, who
would obey orders without taking the law into their
own hands. The occupation was strictly military. It
concerned itself with the business of national suffocation.
All the functions of the national Government
were in German hands. But Belgian policemen
guided the street traffic, arrested culprits for ordinary
misdemeanours, and took them before Belgian judges.
This concession, which also meant a saving in soldiers,
only aggravated to the Belgian the regulations directed
against his personal freedom.</p>

<p>“Eat, drink, and live as usual. Go to your own
police courts for misdemeanours,” was the German
edict in a word; “but remember that ours is the military
power, and no act that aids the enemy, that helps
the cause of Belgium in this war, is permitted. Observe
that particular <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">affiche</i> about a spy, please. He
was shot.”</p>

<p>At every opportunity the Belgians were told that the
British and the French could never come to their
rescue. The Allies were beaten. It was the British
who got Belgium into trouble; the British who were
responsible for the idleness, the penury, the hunger,
and the suffering in Belgium. The British had used
Belgium as a cat’s-paw; then they had deserted her.
But Belgians remained mostly unconvinced. They
were making war with mind and spirit, if not with
arms.</p>

<p>“We know how to suffer in Belgium,” said a Belgian
jurist. “Our ability to suffer and to hold fast to
our hearths has kept us going through the centuries.
Flemish and French, we have stubbornness in common.
Now a ruffian has come into our house and
taken us by the throat. He can choke us to death, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
he can slowly starve us to death, but he cannot make
us yield. No, we shall never forgive!”</p>

<p>“You, too, hate, then?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Of course I hate. For the first time in my life
I know what it is to hate; and so do my countrymen.
I begin to enjoy my hate. It is one of the privileges
of our present existence. We cannot stand on chairs
and tables as they do in Berlin cafés and sing our hate,
but no one can stop our hating in secret.”</p>

<p>Beside the latest <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">verboten</i> and regulation of Belgian
conduct on the city walls were posted German official
news bulletins. The Belgians stopped to read;
they paused to reread. And these were the rare occasions
when they smiled, and they liked to have a German
sentry see that smile.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Pour les enfants!</i>” they whispered, as if talking
to one another about a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">crèche</i>. Little ones, be good!
Here is a new fairy tale!</p>

<p>When a German wanted to buy something he got
frigid politeness and attention&mdash;very frigid, telling
politeness&mdash;from the clerk, which said:</p>

<p>“Beast! Invader! I do not ask you to buy, but
as you ask, I sell; and as I sell I hate! I hate!! I
hate!!!”</p>

<p>An officer entering a shop and seeing a picture of
King Albert on the wall, said:</p>

<p>“The orders are to take that down!”</p>

<p>“But don’t you love your Kaiser?” asked the
woman, who kept the shop.</p>

<p>“Certainly!”</p>

<p>“And I love my King!” was the answer. “I like
to look at his picture just as much as you like to look at
your Kaiser’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
“I had not thought of it in that way!” said the
officer.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is very hard for any conqueror to think of
it in that way. So the picture remained on the wall.</p>

<p>How many soldiers would it take to enforce the
regulation that no Belgian was to wear the Belgian
colours? Imagine thousands and thousands of Landsturm
men moving about and plucking King Albert’s
face or the black, yellow and red from Belgian buttonholes!
No sooner would a buttonhole be cleared in
front than the emblem would appear in a buttonhole
in the rear. The Landsturm would face counter,
flank, frontal, and rear attacks in a most amusing military
manœuvre, which would put those middle-aged
conquerors fearfully out of breath and be rare sport
for the Belgians. You could not arrest the whole
population and lead them off to jail; and if you bayoneted
a few&mdash;which really those phlegmatic, comfortable
old Landsturms would not have the heart to do
for such a little thing&mdash;why, it would get into the
American press and the Berlin Foreign Office would
say:</p>

<p>“There you are, you soldiers, breaking all the crockery
again!”</p>

<p>In the smaller towns, where the Germans were billeted
in Belgian houses, of course the hosts had to
serve their unwelcome guests.</p>

<p>“Yet we managed to let them know what was in our
hearts,” said one woman. “Some tried to be friendly.
They said they had wives and children at home; and
we said: ‘How glad your wives and children would
be to see you! Why don’t you go home?’”</p>

<p>When a report reached the commander in Ghent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
that an old man had concealed arms, a sergeant with a
guard was sent to search the house.</p>

<p>“Yes, my son has a rifle.”</p>

<p>“Where is it?”</p>

<p>“In his hands on the Yser, if he is not dead, monsieur.
You are welcome to search, monsieur.”</p>

<p>Belgium was developing a new humour: a humour
at the expense of the Germans. In their homes they
mimicked their rulers as freely as they pleased. To
carry mimicry into the streets meant arrest for the elders,
but not always for the children. You have heard
the story, which is true, of how some gamins put carrots
in old bowler hats to represent the spikes of German
helmets, and at their leader’s command of “On
to Paris!” did a goose-step backwards. There is another
which you may not have heard of a small boy
who put on grandfather’s spectacles, a pillow under
his coat, and a card on his cap, “Officer of the Landsturm.”
The conquerors had enough sense not to interfere
with the battalion which was taking Paris; but
the pseudo-Landsturm officer was chased into a doorway
and got a cuff after his placard was taken away
from him.</p>

<p>When a united public opinion faces bayonets it is not
altogether helpless to reply. By the atmospheric
force of mass it enjoys a conquest of its own. If a
German officer or soldier entered a street car, women
drew aside in a way to indicate that they did not want
their garments contaminated. People walked by the
sentries in the streets giving them room as you would
give a mangy dog room, yet as if they did not see the
sentries; as if no sentries existed.</p>

<p>The Germans said that they wanted to be friendly.
They even expressed surprise that the Belgians would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
not return their advances. They sent out invitations
to social functions in Brussels, but no one came&mdash;not
even to a ball given by the soldiers to the daughters of
the poor. Belgium stared its inhospitality, its contempt,
its cynical drolleries at the invader.</p>

<p>I kept thinking of a story I heard in Alaska of a
man who had shown himself yellow by cheating his
partner out of a mine. He appeared one day hungry
at a cabin occupied by half a dozen men who knew
him. They gave him food and a bunk that night; they
gave him breakfast; they even carried his blanket roll
out to his sled and harnessed his dogs as a hint, and
saw him go without one man having spoken to him.
No matter if that man believed he had done no wrong,
he would have needed a rhinoceros’ hide not to have
felt this silence. Such treatment the Belgians have
given to the Germans, except that they furnished the
shelter and harnessed the team under duress, as they
so specifically indicate by every act. No wonder,
then, that the old Landsturm guards, used at home to
saying “<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Wie gehts?</i>” and getting a cheery answer
from the people they passed in the streets, were
lonely.</p>

<p>Not only stubborn, but shrewd, these Belgians.
Both qualities were brought out in the officials who had
to deal with the Germans, particularly in the small
towns and where destruction had been worst. Take,
for example, M. Nerincx, of Louvain, who has energy
enough to carry him buoyantly through an American
political campaign, speaking from morning to midnight.
He had been in America. I insisted that he
ought to give up his professorship, get naturalised, and
run for office at home. I know that he would soon be
mayor of a town, or in Congress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
When the war began he was professor of international
law at the ancient university whose walls alone
stand, surrounding the ashes of its priceless volumes,
across from the ruined cathedral. With the burgomaster
a refugee from the horrors of that orgy, he
turned man of action on behalf of the demoralised people
of the town with a thousand homes in ruins. Very
lucky the client in its lawyer. He is the kind of man
who makes the best of the situation; picks up the
fragments of the pitcher, cements them together with
the first material at hand, and goes for more milk.
It was he who got a German commander to sign an
agreement not to “kill, burn, or plunder” any more,
and the signs were still up on some houses saying that
“This house is not to be burned except by official order.”</p>

<p>There in the Hôtel de Ville, which is quite unharmed,
he had his office within reach of the German
commander. He yielded to Cæsar and protected his
own people day in and day out, diplomatic, watchful,
Belgian. And he was cheerful. What other people
could have preserved any vestige of it! Sometimes
one wondered if it were not partly due to an absence
of keen nerve-sensibilities, or to some other of the
traits which are a product of the Belgian hothouse and
Belgian inheritance.</p>

<p>I might tell you about M. Nerincx’s currency system;
how he issued paper promises to pay when he
gave employment to the idle in repairing those houses
which permitted of being repaired and cleaned the
streets of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débris</i>, till ruined Louvain looked as shipshape
as ruined Pompeii; and how he got a little real
money from Brussels to stop depreciation when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
storekeepers came to him and said that they had stacks
of his notes which no mercantile concern would cash.</p>

<p>M. Nerincx was practising in the life about all that
he ever learned and taught at the university, “which
we shall rebuild!” he declared, with cheery confidence.
“You will help us in America,” he said.
“I’m going to America to lecture one of these days
about Louvain!”</p>

<p>“You have the most famous ruins, unless it is
Rheims,” I assured him. “You will get flocks of
tourists”&mdash;particularly if he fenced in the ruins of
the library and burned leaves of ancient books were on
sale.</p>

<p>“Then you will not only have fed, but have helped
to rebuild Belgium,” he added.</p>

<p>A shadow of apprehension overhung his anticipation
of the day of Belgium’s delivery. Many a Belgian
had arms hidden from the alert eye of German
espionage, and his bitterness was solaced by the
thought: “I’ll have a shot at the Germans when they
go!” The lot of the last German soldiers to leave
a town, unless the garrison slips away overnight, would
hardly make him a good life insurance risk.</p>

<p>My last look at a Belgian bread line was at Liége,
that town which had had a blaze of fame in August,
1914, and was now almost forgotten. An industrial
town, its mines and works were idle. The Germans
had removed the machinery for rifle-making, which
has become the most valuable kind of machinery in the
world next to that for making guns and shells. If
skilled Belgians here or elsewhere were called upon
to serve the Germans at their craft, they suddenly became
butter-fingered. So that bread line at Liége was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
long, its queue stretching the breadth of the cathedral
square.</p>

<p>As most of the regular German officers in Belgium
were cavalrymen&mdash;there was nothing for cavalry to
do on the Aisne line of trenches&mdash;it was quite in
keeping that the aide to the commandant of Liége,
who looked after my pass to leave the country, should
be a young officer of Hussars. He spoke English
well; he was amiable and intelligent. While I waited
for the commandant to sign the pass he chatted of his
adventures on the pursuit of the British to the Marne.
The British fought like devils, he said. It was a question
if their new army would be so good. He showed
me a photograph of himself in a British Tommy’s
overcoat.</p>

<p>“When we took some prisoners I was interested in
their overcoats,” he explained. “I asked one of the
Tommies to let me try on his. It fitted me perfectly,
so I kept it as a souvenir and had this photograph
made to show my friends.”</p>

<p>Perhaps a shade of surprise passed over my face.</p>

<p>“You don’t understand,” he said. “That Tommy
had to give me his coat! He was a prisoner.”</p>

<p>On my way out from Liége I was to see Visé&mdash;the
town of the gateway&mdash;the first town of the war to
suffer from frightfulness. I had thought of it as entirely
destroyed. A part of it had survived.</p>

<p>A delightful old Bavarian Landsturm man searched
me for contraband letters when our cart stopped on
the Belgian side of a barricade at Maastricht, with
Dutch soldiers on the other side. His examination
was a little perfunctory, almost apologetic, and he did
want to be friendly. You guessed that he was thinking
he would like to go around the corner and have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
“<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">ein Glas Bier</i>” rather than search me. What a
hearty “<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Auf wiedersehen!</i>” he gave me when he saw
that I was inclined to be friendly, too!</p>

<p>I was glad to be across that frontier, with a last
stamp on my <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Passierschein</i>; glad to be out of the land
of those ghostly Belgian millions in their living death;
glad not to have to answer again their ravenously
whispered “When?” When would the Allies
come?</p>

<p>The next time that I was in Belgium it was in the
British lines of the Ypres salient, two months later.
When should I be next in Brussels? With a victorious
British army, I hoped. A long wait it was to be for
a conquered people, listening each day and trying to
think that the sound of gun-fire was nearer.</p>

<p>The stubborn, passive resistance and self-sacrifice
that I have pictured was that of a moral leadership
of a majority shaming the minority; or an ostracism of
all who had relations with the enemy. Of course, it
was not the spirit of the whole. The American Commission,
as charity usually must, had to overcome obstacles
set in its path by those whom it would aid.
Belgian politicians, in keeping with the weakness of
their craft, could no more forego playing politics in
time of distress than some that we had in San Francisco
and some we have heard of only across the British
Channel from Belgium.</p>

<p>Zealous leaders exaggerated the famine of their districts
in order to get larger supplies; communities in
great need without spokesmen must be reached; powerful
towns found excuses for not forwarding food to
small villages which were without influence. Natural
greed got the better of men used to turning a penny
anyway they could. Rascally bakers who sifted the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
brown flour to get the white to sell to <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">patisseries</i> and
the well-to-do, while the bread line got the bran, required
shrewd handling when the only means of punishment
was through German authority.</p>

<p>“The local burgomaster yesterday offered to sell
me some of your Commission’s flour,” wrote a German
commandant. “I bought it and have the receipt,
in order to prove to you that these Belgians are what
we say they are&mdash;a vile people. I am turning the
flour over to your Commission. We said that we
would not take any of it and the German Government
keeps its word.”</p>

<p>How that commandant enjoyed making that score!
As for the burgomaster, he was proscribed in a way
that will brand him among his fellow-citizens for life.
When German soldiers took bread from families
where they were billeted, the German Government
turned over an amount of flour equivalent to the bread
consumed.</p>

<p>A certain percentage of Belgians saw the invasion
only as a visitation of disaster, like an earthquake.
A flat country of gardens limits one’s horizon. They
fell in line with the sentiment of the mass. But as
time wore on into the summer and autumn of the second
year, some of them began to think, What was the
use? German propaganda was active. All that the
Allies had cared for Belgium was to use her to check
the German tide to Paris and the Channel ports!
Perfidious England had betrayed Belgium! German
business and banking influences, which had been considerable
in Belgium before the war, and the numerous
German residents who had returned, formed a busy
circle of appeal to Belgian business men, who were told
that the British navy stood between them and a return<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
to prosperity. Germany was only too willing that
they should resume their trade with the rest of the
world.</p>

<p>Why should not Belgium come into the German customs
union? Why should not Belgium make the best
of her unfortunate situation, as became a practical
and thrifty people? But be it a customs union or
annexation that Germany plans, the steel had entered
the hearts of all Belgians with red corpuscles; and
King Albert and his <i xml:lang="be" lang="be">shipperkes</i> were still fighting the
Germans at Dixmude. A British army appearing before
Brussels would end casuistry; and pessimism
would pass, and the German residents, too, with the
huzzas of all Belgium as the gallant King once more
ascended the steps of his palace.</p>

<p>Worthy of England at her best was her consent to
allow the Commission’s food to pass, which she accompanied
by generous giving. She might be slow in
making ready her army, but give she could and give
she did. It was a grave question if her consent was
in keeping with the military policy which believes that
any concession to sentiment in the grim business of war
is unwise. Certainly, the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Krieg ist Krieg</i> of Germany
would not have permitted it.</p>

<p>There is the very point of the war that makes a
neutral take sides. If the Belgians had not received
bread from the outside world, then Germany would
either have had to spare enough to keep them from
starving or faced the desperation of a people who fight
for food with such weapons as they had. This must
have meant a holocaust of reprisals that would have
made the orgy of Louvain comparatively unimportant.
However much the Germans hampered the Commission
with red tape and worse than red tape through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
the activities of German residents in Belgium, Germany
did not want the Commission to withdraw. It
was helping her to economise her food supplies. And
England answered a human appeal at the cost of hard
and fast military policy. She was still true to the
ideals which have set their stamp on half the world.</p></div>

lines&mdash;View of the German wedge&mdash;French veterans&mdash;Ancient
Lorraine&mdash;A vision of battle&mdash;Résumé of the struggle&mdash;The

<p>Only a winding black streak, that four hundred and
fifty miles of trenches on a flat map. It is difficult to
visualise the whole as you see it in your morning paper,
or to realise the labour it represents in its course
through the mire and over mountain slopes, through
villages and thick forests and across open fields.</p>

<p>Every mile of it was located by the struggle of guns
and rifles and men coming to a stalemate of effort,
when both dug into the earth and neither could budge
the other. It is a line of countless battles and broken
hopes; of as brave charges as men ever made; a symbol
of skill and dogged patience and eternal vigilance
of striving foe against striving foe.</p>

<p>From the first, the sector from Rheims to Flanders
was most familiar to the public. The world still
thinks of the battle of the Marne as an affair at the
door of Paris, though the heaviest fighting was from
Vitry le François eastward and the fate of Paris was
no less decided on the fields of Lorraine than on the
fields of Champagne. The storming of Rheims cathedral<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
became the theme of thousands of words of print
to one word for the defence of the Plateau d’Amance
or the struggle around Lunéville. Our knowledge of
the war is from glimpses through the curtain of military
secrecy which was drawn tight over Lorraine and
the Vosges, shrouded in mountain mists. This is
about Lorraine in winter, when the war was six months
old.</p>

<p>But first, on our way, a word about Paris, which I
had not seen since September. At the outset of the
war, Parisians who had not gone to the front were in
a trance of suspense; they were magnetised by the
tragic possibilities of the hour. The fear of disaster
was in their hearts, though they might deny it to themselves.
They could think of nothing but France.
Now they realised that the best way to help France
was by going on with their work at home. Paris was
trying to be normal, but no Parisian was making the
bluff that Paris was normal. The Gallic lucidity of
mind prevented such self-deception.</p>

<p>Is it normal to have your sons, brothers, and husbands
up to their knees in icy water in the trenches, in
danger of death every minute? This attitude seems
human; it seems logical. One liked the French for it.
He liked them for boasting so little. In their effort
at normality they had accomplished more than they
realised. After all, only one-thirtieth of the area of
France was in German hands. A line of steel made
the rest safe for those not at the front to pursue the
routine of peace.</p>

<p>When I had been in Paris in September there was
no certainty about railroad connections anywhere.
You went to the station and took your chances, governed
by the movement of troops, not to mention other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
conditions. This time I took the regular noon express
to Nancy, as I might have done to Marseilles, or
Rome, or Madrid, had I chosen. The sprinkling of
quiet army officers on the train were in the new uniform
of peculiar steely grey, in place of the target blue
and red. But for them and the number of women in
mourning and one other circumstance, the train might
have been bound for Berlin, with Nancy only a stop on
the way.</p>

<p>The other circumstance was the presence of a soldier
in the vestibule who said: “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Votre laisser-passer,
monsieur, s’il vous plaît!</i>” If you had a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laisser-passer</i>,
he was most polite; but if you lacked one, he
would also have been most polite and so would the
guard that took you in charge at the next station. In
other words, monsieur, you must have something besides
a railroad ticket if you are on a train that runs
past the fortress of Toul and your destination is
Nancy. You must have a military pass, which was
never given to foreigners if they were travelling alone
in the zone of military operations. The pulse of the
Frenchman beats high, his imagination bounds, when
he looks eastward. To the east are the lost provinces
and the frontier drawn by the war of ’70 between
French Lorraine and German Lorraine. This
gave our journey interest.</p>

<p>Nancy, capital of French Lorraine, is so near Metz,
the great German fortress town of German Lorraine,
that excursion trains used to run to Nancy in the opera
season. “They are not running this winter,” say the
wits of Nancy. “For one reason, we have no opera&mdash;and
there are other reasons.”</p>

<p>An aeroplane from the German lines has only to
toss a bomb in the course of an average reconnaissance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
on Nancy if it chooses; Zeppelins are within easy commuting
distance. But here was Nancy as brilliantly
lighted at nine in the evening as any city of its size at
home. Our train, too, had run with the windows unshaded.
After the darkness of London, and after
English trains with every window shade closely drawn,
this was a surprise.</p>

<p>It was a threat, an anticipation, that has darkened
London, while Nancy knew fulfilment. Bombardment
and bomb dropping were nothing new to Nancy.
The spice of danger gives a fillip to business in the
town whose population heard the din of the most
thunderously spectacular action of the war echoing
among the surrounding hills. Nancy saw the enemy
beaten back. Now she was so close to the front that
she felt the throb of the army’s life.</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever worry about aerial raids?” I
asked madame behind the counter at the hotel.</p>

<p>“Do the men in the trenches worry about them?”
she answered. “We have a much easier time than
they. Why shouldn’t we share some of their dangers?
And when a Zeppelin appears and our guns
begin firing, we all feel like soldiers under fire.”</p>

<p>“Are all the population here as usual?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, monsieur!” she said. “The Germans
can never take Nancy. The French are going to take
Metz!”</p>

<p>The meal which that hotel restaurant served was as
good as in peace times. Who deserves a good meal
if not the officer who comes in from the front? And
madame sees that he gets it. She is as proud of her
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poulet en casserole</i> as any commander of a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">soixante-quinze</i>
battery of its practice. There was steam heat,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
too, in the hotel, which gave an American a homelike
feeling.</p>

<p>In a score of places in the Eastern States you see
landscapes with high hills like the spurs of the Vosges
around Nancy sprinkled with snow and under a blue
mist. And the air was dry; it had the life of our air.
Old Civil War men who had been in the Tennessee
Mountains or the Shenandoah Valley would feel perfectly
at home in such surroundings; only the foreground
of farm land which merges into the crests covered
with trees in the distance is more finished. The
people were tilling it hundreds of years before we began
tilling ours. They till well; they make Lorraine
a rich province of France.</p>

<p>With guns pounding in the distance, boys in their
capes were skipping and frolicking on their way to
school; housewives were going to market, and the
streets were spotlessly clean. All the men of Nancy
not in the army pursued their regular routine while
the army went about its business of throwing shells at
the Germans. On the dead walls of the buildings
were M. Deschanel’s speech in the Chamber of Deputies,
breathing endurance till victory, and the call for
the class of recruits of 1915, which you will find on
the walls of the towns of all France beside that of
the order of mobilisation in August, now weather-stained.
Nancy seemed, if anything, more French
than any interior French town. Though near the
border, there is no touch of German influence. When
you walked through the old Place Stanislaus, so expressive
of the architectural taste bred for centuries
in the French, you understand the glow in the hearts of
this very French population which made them unconscious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
of danger while their flag was flying over this
very French city.</p>

<p>No two Christian peoples we know are quite so different
as the French and the Germans. To each
every national thought and habit incarnates a patriotism
which is in defiance of that on the other side of
the frontier. Over in America you may see the good
in both sides, but no Frenchman and no German can
on the Lorraine frontier. If he should, he would no
longer be a Frenchman or a German in time of war.</p>

<p>At our service in front of the hotel were waiting
two mortals in goatskin coats, with scarfs around their
ears and French military caps on top of the scarfs.
They were official army chauffeurs. If you have
ridden through the Alleghenies in winter in an open
car why explain that seeing the Vosges front in an
automobile may be a joy ride to an Eskimo, but not to
your humble servant? But the roads were perfect;
as good wherever we went in this mountain country
as from New York to Poughkeepsie. I need not tell
you this if you have been in France; but you will be
interested to know that Lorraine keeps her roads in
perfect repair even in war time.</p>

<p>Crossing the swollen Moselle on a military bridge,
twisting in and out of valleys and speeding through villages,
one saw who were guarding the army’s secrets,
but little of the army itself and few signs of transportation
on a bleak, snowy day. At the outskirts of
every village, at every bridge, and at intervals along
the road, Territorial sentries stopped the car. Having
an officer along was not sufficient to let you whizz by
important posts. He must show his pass. Every
sentry was a reminder of the hopelessness of being a
correspondent these days without official sanction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
The sentries were men in the thirties. In Belgium,
their German counterpart, the Landsturm, were the
monitors of a journey that I made. No troops are
more military than the first line Germans; but in the
snap and spirit of his salute the French Territorial has
an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élan</i>, a martial fervour, which the phlegmatic German
in the thirties lacks.</p>

<p>Occasionally we passed scattered soldiers in the village
streets, or a door opened to show a soldier figure
in the doorway. The reason that we were not seeing
anything of the army was the same that keeps the
men and boys who are on the steps of the country
grocery in summer at home around the stove in winter.
All these villages were full of reservists who
were indoors. They could be formed in the street
ready for the march to any part of the line where a
concentrated attack was made almost as soon after
the alarm as a fire engine starts to a fire.</p>

<p>Now, imagine your view of a ball game limited to
the batter and the pitcher: and that is all you see in
the low country of Flanders. You have no grasp
of what all the noise and struggle means, for you
cannot see over the shoulders of the crowd. But in
Lorraine you have only to ascend a hill and the moves
in the chess game of war are clear.</p>

<p>A panorama unfolds as our car takes a rising grade
to the village of Ste. Geneviève. We alight and walk
along a bridge, where the sentry or a lookout is on
watch. He seems quite alone, but at our approach
a dozen of his comrades come out of their “home”
dug in the hillside. Wherever you go about the
frozen country of Lorraine it is a case of flushing soldiers
from their shelters. A small, semicircular table
is set up before the lookout, like his compass before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
a mariner. Here run blue pencil lines of direction
pointing to Pont-à-Mousson, to Château-Salins, and
other towns. Before us to the east rose the tree-clad
crests of the famous Grand Couronné of Nancy, and
faintly in the distance we could see Metz, that strong
fortress town in German Lorraine.</p>

<p>“Those guns that I hear, are they firing across the
frontier?” I asked. For some French batteries command
one of the outer forts of Metz.</p>

<p>“No, they are near Pont-à-Mousson.”</p>

<p>To the north the little town of Pont-à-Mousson lay
in the lap of the river bottom, and across the valley,
to the west, the famous Bois le Prêtre. More guns
were speaking from the forest depths, which showed
great scars where the trees had been cut to give fields
of fire. This was well to the rear of our position&mdash;marking
the boundaries of the wedge that the Germans
drove into the French lines, with its point at St.
Mihiel&mdash;in trying to isolate the forts of Verdun and
Toul. Doubtless you have noticed that wedge on the
snake maps and have wondered about it, as I have.
It looks so narrow that the French ought to be able
to shoot across it from both sides. If not, why don’t
the Germans widen it?</p>

<p>Well, for one thing, a quarter of an inch on a map
is a good many miles of ground. The Germans cannot
spread their wedge because they would have to
climb the walls of an alley. That was a fact as clear
to the eye as the valley of the Hudson from West
Point. The Germans occupy an alley within an alley,
as it were. They have their own natural defences for
the edges of their wedge; or, where they do not, they
lie cheek by jowl with the French in such thick woods
as the Bois le Prêtre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
At our feet, looking toward Metz, an apron of cultivated
land swept down for a mile or more to a
forest edge. This was cut by lines of trenches;
whose barbed wire protection pricked a blanket of
snow.</p>

<p>“Our front is in those woods,” explained the colonel
who was in command of the point.</p>

<p>“A major when the war began and an officer of
reserves,” <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon capitaine</i>, who had brought us out
from Paris, explained about the colonel. We were
soon used to hearing that a colonel had been a major
or a major a captain before the Kaiser had tried to
get Nancy. There was quick death and speedy promotion
at the great battle of Lorraine, as there was at
Gettysburg and Antietam.</p>

<p>“They charged out of the woods, and we had a
battalion of reserves&mdash;here are some of them&mdash;<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mes
poilus</i>!”</p>

<p>He turned affectionately to the bearded fellows in
scarfs who had come out of the shelter. They smiled
back. Now, as we all chatted together, officer-and-man
distinction disappeared. We were in a family
party.</p>

<p>It was all very simple to <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mes poilus</i>, that first fight.
They had been told to hold. If Ste. Geneviève were
lost, the Amance plateau was in danger, and the loss
of the Amance plateau meant the fall of Nancy.
Some military martinets say that the soldiers of France
think too much. In this case thinking may have taught
them responsibility. So they held; they lay tight,
these reserves, and kept on firing as the Germans
swarmed out of the woods.</p>

<p>“And the Germans stopped there, monsieur.
They hadn’t very far to go, had they? But the last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
fifty yards, monsieur, are the hardest travelling when
you are trying to take a trench.”</p>

<p>They knew, these <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilus</i>, these veterans. Every
soldier who serves in Lorraine knows. They themselves
have tried to rush out of the edge of a woods
across an open space against intrenched Germans, and
found the shoe on the other foot.</p>

<p>Now the fields in the foreground down to the wood’s
edge were bare of any living thing. You had to take
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon capitaine’s</i> word for it that there were any soldiers
in front of us.</p>

<p>“The <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boches</i> are a good distance away at this
point,” he said. “They are in the next woods.”</p>

<p>A broad stretch of snow lay between the two clumps
of woods. It was not worth while for either side to
try to get possession of the intervening space. At the
first movement by either French or Germans the
woods opposite would hum with rifle fire and echo
with cannonading. So, like rival parties of Arctic
explorers waiting out the Arctic winter, they watched
each other. But if one force or the other napped,
and the other caught him at it, then winter would not
stay a brigade commander’s ambition. Three days
later in this region the French, by a quick movement,
got a good bag of prisoners to make a welcome item
for the daily French official bulletin.</p>

<p>“We wait and the Germans wait on spring for
any big movement,” said the colonel. “Men can’t lie
out all night in the advance in weather like this. In
that direction&mdash;” He indicated a part of the line
where the two armies were facing each other across
the old frontier. Back and forth they had fought,
only to arrive where they had begun.</p>

<p>There was something else which the colonel wished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
us to see before we left the hill of Ste. Geneviève. It
appealed to his Gallic sentiment, this quadrilateral of
stone on the highest point where legend tells that
“Jovin, a Christian and very faithful, vanquished the
German barbarians 366 <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>”</p>

<p>“We have to do as well in our day as Jovin in
his,” remarked the colonel.</p>

<p>The church of Ste. Geneviève was badly smashed by
shell. So was the church in the village on the Plateau
d’Amance. Most churches in this district of Lorraine
are. Framed through a great gap in the wall
of the church of Amance was an immense Christ on
the cross without a single abrasion, and a pile of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débris</i>
at its feet. After seeing as many ruined churches as
I have, one becomes almost superstitious at how often
the figures of Christ escape. But I have also seen
effigies of Christ blown to bits.</p>

<p>Any one who, from an eminence, has seen one battle
fought visualises another readily when the positions lie
at his feet. Looking out on the field of Gettysburg
from Round Top, I can always get the same thrill
that I had when, seated in a gallery above the Russian
and the Japanese armies, I saw the battle of Liao-yang.
In sight of that Plateau d’Amance, which rises
like a great knuckle above the surrounding country, a
battle covering twenty times the extent of Gettysburg
raged, and one could have looked over a battle-line
as far as the eye may see from a steamer’s mast.</p>

<p>An icy gale swept across the white crest of the plateau
on this January day, but it was nothing to the
gale of shells that descended on it in late August and
early September. Forty thousand shells, it is estimated,
fell there. One kicked up fragments of steel
on the field like peanut shells after a circus has gone.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Here were the emplacements of a battery of French
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">soixante-quinze</i> within a circle of holes torn by its adversaries’
replies to its fire; a little farther along, concealed
by shrubbery, the position of another battery
which the enemy had not located.</p>

<p>“So that was it!” The struggle on the immense
landscape, where at least a quarter of a million men
were killed and wounded, became as simple as some
Brobdignagian football match. Before the war began
the French would not move a man within five
miles of the frontier lest it be provocative: but once
the issue was joined they sprang for Alsace and Lorraine,
their imagination magnetised by the thought of
the recovery of the lost provinces. Their Alpine
chasseurs, mountain men of the Alpine and the Pyrenees
districts, were concentrated for the purpose.</p>

<p>I recalled a remark I had heard: “What a pitiful
little offensive that was!” It was made by one of
those armchair “military experts,” who look at a map
and jump at a conclusion. They appear very wise in
their wordiness when real military experts are silent
for want of knowledge. Pitiful, was it? Ask the
Germans who faced it what they think. Pitiful, that
sweep over those mountain walls and through the
passes? Pitiful, perhaps, because it failed, though
not until it had taken Château-Salins in the north and
Mulhouse in the south. Ask the Germans if they
think that it was pitiful! The Confederates also
failed at Antietam and at Gettysburg, but the Union
army never thought of their efforts as pitiful.</p>

<p>The French fell back because all the weight of the
German army was thrown against France, while the
Austrians were left to look after the slowly mobilising
Russians. Two million five hundred thousand men on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
their first line the Germans had, as we know now,
against the French twelve hundred thousand. To
make sure of saving Paris as the Germans swung their
mighty flanking column through Belgium, Joffre had
to draw in his lines. The Germans came over the
hills as splendidly as the French had gone. They
struck in all directions toward Paris. In Lorraine
was their left flank, the Bavarians, meant to play the
same part to the east that von Kluck played to the
west. We heard only of von Kluck and the British
retreat from Mons; nothing of this terrific struggle in
Lorraine.</p>

<p>From the Plateau d’Amance you may see how far
the Germans came and what was their object. Between
the fortresses of Épinal and of Toul lies the
Troueé de Mirecourt&mdash;the Gap of Mirecourt. It is
said that the French had purposely left it open when
they were thinking of fighting the Germans on their
own frontier and not on that of Belgium. They
wanted the Germans to make their trial here&mdash;and
wisely, for with all the desperate and courageous efforts
of the Bavarian and Saxon armies they never
got near the gap.</p>

<p>If they had forced it, however, with von Kluck
swinging on the other flank, they might have got
around the French army. Such was the dream of
German strategy, whose realisation was so boldly and
skilfully undertaken. The Germans counted on their
immense force of artillery, built for this war in the
last two years and outranging the French, to demoralise
the French infantry. But the French infantry
called the big shells “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">marmites</i>” (saucepans), and
made a joke of them and the death they spread as
they tore up the fields in clouds of earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Ah, it took more than artillery to beat back the
best troops of France in a country like this&mdash;a country
of rolling hills and fenceless fields cut by many
streams and set among thick woods, where infantry
on a bank or at a forest’s edge with rifles and rapid-firers
and guns kept their barrels cool until the charge
developed in the open. Some of these forests are
only a few acres in extent; others are hundreds of
acres. In the dark depths of one a frozen lake was
seen glistening from our position on the Plateau
d’Amance.</p>

<p>“Indescribable that scene which we witnessed from
here,” said an officer, who had been on the plateau
throughout the fighting. “All the splendid majesty
of war was set on a stage before you. It was intoxication.
We could see the lines of troops in their retreat
and advance, batteries and charges shrouded in
shrapnel smoke. What hosts of guns the Germans
had! They seemed to be sowing the whole face of
the earth with shells. The roar of the thing was like
that of chaos itself. It was the exhilaration of the
spectacle that kept us from dropping from fatigue.
Two weeks of this business! Two weeks with every
unit of artillery and infantry always ready, if not actually
engaged!”</p>

<p>The general in command was directing not one but
many battles, each with a general of its own; manœuvring
troops across the streams and open places,
seeking the cover of forests, with the aeroplanes unable
to learn how many of the enemy were hidden in
the forests on his front, while he tried to keep his men
out of angles and make his movements correspond
with those of the divisions on his right and left. Skill
this requires; skill equivalent to German skill; the skill<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
which you cannot organise in a month after calling for
a million volunteers, but which grows through years
of organisation.</p>

<p>Shall I call the general in chief command General
X? This is according to the custom of anonymity.
A great modern army like the French is a machine;
any man, high or low, only a unit of the machine. In
this case the real name of X is Castelnau. If it lacks
the fame which may seem its due, that may be because
he was not operating near a transatlantic cable end.
Fame is not the business of French generals nowadays.
It is war. What counted for France was that he
never let the Germans get near the gap at Mirecourt.</p>

<p>Having failed to reach the gap, the Germans, with
that stubbornness of the offensive which characterises
them, tried to take Nancy. They got a battery of
heavy guns within range of the city. From a high
hill it is said that the Kaiser watched the bombardment.
But here is a story. As the German infantry
advanced toward their new objective they passed a
French artillery officer in a tree. He was able to locate
that heavy battery and able to signal its position
back to his own side. The French concentrated sufficient
fire to silence it after it had thrown forty shells
into Nancy. The same report tells how the Kaiser
folded his cloak around him and walked down in
silence from his eminence, where the sun blazed on his
helmet. It was not the Germans’ fault that they failed
to take Nancy. It was due to the French.</p>

<p>Some time a tablet will be put up to denote the high-water
mark of the German invasion of Lorraine. It
will be between the edge of the forest of Champenoux
and the heights. When the Germans charged from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
the cover of the forest to get possession of the road to
Nancy, the French guns and mitrailleuses which had
held their fire turned loose. The rest of the story
is how the French infantry, impatient at being held
back, swept down in a counter-attack, and the Germans
had to give up their campaign in Lorraine as
they gave up their campaign against Paris in the early
part of September. Saddest of all lost opportunities
to the correspondent in this war is this fighting in Lorraine.
One had only to climb a hill in order to see
it all!</p>

<p>In half an hour, as the officer outlined the positions,
we had lived through the two weeks’ fighting;
and, thanks to the fairness of his story&mdash;that of a
professional soldier without illusions&mdash;we felt that
we had been hearing history while it was very fresh.</p>

<p>“They are very brave and skilful, the Germans,”
he said. “We still have a battery of heavy guns on
the plateau. Let us go and see it.”</p>

<p>We went, picking our way among the snow-covered
shell pits. At one point we crossed a communicating
trench, where soldiers could go and come to the guns
and the infantry positions without being exposed to
shell fire. I noticed that it carried a telephone wire.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the officer; “we had no ditch during
the fight with the Germans, and we were short of telephone
wire for a while; so we had to carry messages
back and forth as in the old days. It was a pretty
warm kind of messenger service when the German
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">marmites</i> were falling their thickest.”</p>

<p>At length he stopped before a small mound of earth
not in any way distinctive at a short distance on the
uneven surface of the plateau. I did not even notice
that there were three other such mounds. He pointed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
to a hole in the ground. I had been used to going
through a manhole in a battleship turret, but not
through one into a field-gun position before aeroplanes
played a part in war.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Entrez, monsieur!</i>”</p>

<p>And I stepped down to face the breech of a gun
whose muzzle pointed out of another hole in the timbered
roof covered with earth.</p>

<p>“It’s very cosy!” I remarked.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is the shop! The living-room is below&mdash;here!”</p>

<p>I descended a ladder into a cellar ten feet below
the gun level, where some of the gunners were lying
on a thick carpet of perfectly dry straw.</p>

<p>“You are not doing much firing these days?” I
suggested.</p>

<p>“Oh, we gave the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boches</i> a couple this morning so
they wouldn’t get cocky thinking they were safe. It’s
necessary to keep your hand in even in the winter.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you get lonesome?”</p>

<p>“No, we shift on and off. We’re not here all the
while. It is quite warm in our salon, monsieur, and
we have good comrades. It is war. It is for France.
What would you?”</p>

<p>Four other gun positions and four other cellars like
this! Thousands of gun positions and thousands of
cellars! Man invents new powers of destruction and
man finds a way of escaping them.</p>

<p>As we left the battery we started forward, and suddenly
out of the dusk came a sharp call. A young
corporal confronted us. Who were we and what business
had we prowling about on that hill? If there
had been no officer along and I had not had a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laisser-passer</i>
on my person, the American Ambassador to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
France would probably have had to get another countryman
out of trouble.</p>

<p>The incident shows how thoroughly the army is policed
and how surely. Editors who wonder why their
correspondents are not in the front line catching bullets,
please take notice.</p>

<p>It was dark when we returned to the little village
on the plateau where we had left our car. The place
seemed uninhabited with all the blinds closed. But
through one uncovered window I saw a room full of
chatting soldiers. We went to pay our respects to the
colonel in command, and found him and his staff
around a table covered with oilcloth in the main living-room
of a villager’s house. He spoke of his men,
of their loyalty and cheerfulness, as the other commanders
had, as if this were his only boast. These
French officers have little “side”; none of that toe-the-mark,
strutting militarism which some soldiers
think necessary to efficiency. They live very simply
on campaign, though if they do get to town for a few
hours they enjoy a good meal. If they did not,
madame at the restaurant would feel that she was not
doing her duty to France.</p></div>

<p>Scorched piles of brick and mortar where a home has
been ought to make about the same impression anywhere.
When you have gone from Belgium to French
Lorraine, however, you will know quite the contrary.
In Belgium I suffered all the depression which a nightmare
of war’s misery can bring; in French Lorraine I
found myself sharing something of the elation of a
man who looks at a bruised knuckle with the consciousness
that it broke a burglar’s jaw.</p>

<p>A Belgian repairing the wreck of his house was a
grim, heartbreaking picture; a Frenchman of Lorraine
repairing the wreck of his house had the light of hard-won
victory, of confidence, of sacrifice made to a great
purpose, of freedom secure for future generations, in
his eyes. The difference was this: The Germans
were still in Belgium; they were out of French Lorraine
for good.</p>

<p>“What matters a shell-hole through my walls and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
my torn roof!” said a Lorraine farmer. “Work
will make my house whole. But nothing could ever
have made my heart and soul whole while the Germans
remained. I saw them go, monsieur; they left
us ruins, but France is ours!”</p>

<p>I had thought it a pretty good thing to see something
of the Eastern French front; but a better thing
was the happiness I found there. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Mon capitaine</i> had
come out from the Ministry of War in Paris; but
when we set out from Nancy southward, we had a
different local guide, a major belonging to the command
in charge of the region which we were to visit.
He was another example which upsets certain popular
notions of Frenchmen as gesticulating, excitable little
men. Some six feet two in height, he had an eye that
looked straight into yours, a very square chin, and a
fine forehead. You had only to look at him and size
him up on points to conclude that he was all there;
that he knew his work.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got good weather for it to-day,
monsieur,” said a voice out of a goatskin coat, and I
found we had the same chauffeur as before. These
French privates talk to you and you talk to them.
They are not simply moulds of flesh in military form
who salute and salute and salute. They take an interest
in your affairs and you take an interest in theirs;
they make you feel like home folks.</p>

<p>The sun was shining&mdash;a warm winter sun like that
of a February thaw in our Northern States&mdash;glistening
on the snowy fields and slopes among the forests
and tree-clad hills of the mountainous country.
Faces ambushed in whiskers thought it was a good day
for trimming beards and washing clothes. The sentries
along the roads had their scarfs around their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
necks instead of over their ears. A French soldier
makes ear muffs, chest protector, nightcap, and a blanket
out of the scarf which wife or sister knits for him.
If any woman who reads this knits one to send to
France she may be sure that the fellow who received
it will get every stitch’s worth out of it.</p>

<p>To-day, then, it was war without mittens. You did
not have to sound the bugle to get soldiers out of their
burrows or their houses. Our first stop was at our
own request, in a village where groups of soldiers were
taking a sun bath. More came out of the doors as
we alighted. They were all in the late twenties or
early thirties, men of a reserve regiment. Some had
been clerks, some labourers, some farmers, some employers,
when the war began. Then they were <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">piou-pious</i>,
in French slang; then all France prayed god-speed
to its beloved <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">piou-pious</i>. Then you knew the
clerk by his pallor; the labourer by his hard hands;
the employer by his manner of command. Now they
were <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilus</i>&mdash;bearded, hard-eyed veterans; you could
not tell the clerk from the labourer or the employer
from the peasant.</p>

<p>Any one who saw the tenderfoot pilgrimage to the
Alaskan gold field in ’97-’98 and the same crowd six
months later will understand what had happened to
these men. The puny had put on muscle; the city
dweller had blown his lungs; the fat man had lost some
adipose; social differences of habit had disappeared.
That gentleman used to his bath and linen sheets and
the hard living farmer or labourer&mdash;all had had to
eat the same kind of food, do the same work, run the
same risks in battle, and sleep side by side in the houses
where they were lodged and in the dugouts of the
trenches when it was their turn to occupy them through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
the winter. Any “snob” had his edges trimmed by
the banter of his comrades. Their beards accentuated
the likeness of type. A cheery lot of faces and intelligent,
these, which greeted us with curious interest.</p>

<p>“Perhaps President Wilson will make peace,” one
said.</p>

<p>“When?” I asked.</p>

<p>A shrug of the shoulder, a gesture to the East, and
the answer was:</p>

<p>“When we have Alsace-Lorraine back.”</p>

<p>Under a shed their <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déjeuner</i> was cooking. This
meal at noon is the meal of the day to the average
Frenchman, who has only bread and coffee in the morning.
They say he objects to fighting at luncheon time.
That is the hour when he wants to sit down and forget
his work and laugh and talk and enjoy his eating.
The Germans found this out and tried to take his
trenches at the noon hour. This interference with his
gastronomic habits made him so angry that he dropped
the knife and fork for the bayonet and took back any
lost ground in a ferocious counter-attack. He would
teach those “<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boches</i>” to leave him to eat his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déjeuner</i>
in peace.</p>

<p>That appetising stew in the kettles in the shed once
more proved that Frenchmen know how to cook. I
didn’t blame them for objecting to being shot at by
the Germans when they were about to eat it. The
average French soldier is better fed than at home; he
gets more meat, for a hungry soldier is usually a poor
soldier. It is a very simple problem with France’s
fine roads to feed that long line when it is stationary.
It is like feeding a city stretched out over a distance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
four hundred and fifty miles; a stated number of
ounces each day for each man and a known number of
men to feed. From the railroad head trucks and
autobusses take the supplies up to the distributing
points. At one place I saw ten Paris autobusses, their
signs painted out in a steel-grey to hide them from
aeroplanes, and not one of them had broken down
through the war. The French take good care of their
equipment and their clothes; they waste no food. As
a people is, so is their army, and the French are thrifty
by nature.</p>

<p>Father Joffre, as the soldiers call him, is running the
next largest boarding establishment in Europe after
the Kaiser and the Czar. And he has a happy family.
It seemed to me that life ought to have been
utterly dull for this characteristic group of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilus</i>, living
crowded together all winter in a remote village.
Civilians sequestered in this fashion away from home
are inclined to get grouchy on one another.</p>

<p>One of the officers in speaking of this said that early
in the autumn the reserves were pretty homesick.
They wanted to get back to their wives and children.
Nostalgia, next to hunger, is the worst thing for a
soldier. Commanders were worried. But as the
winter wore on the spirit changed. The soldiers began
to feel the spell of their democratic comradeship.
The fact that they had fought together and survived
together played its part; and individualism was sunk
in the one thought that they were there for France.
The fellowship of a cause taught them patience,
brought them cheer. And another thing was the increasing
sense of team play, of confidence in victory,
which holds a ball team, a business enterprise, or an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
army together. Every day the organisation of the
army was improving; every day that indescribable and
subtle element of satisfaction that the Germans were
securely held was growing.</p>

<p>Every Frenchman saves something of his income;
madame sees to it that he does. He knows that if he
dies he will not leave wife and children penniless.
His son, not yet old enough to fight, will come on to
take his place. Men at home who are twenty-two or
three and unmarried, men who are twenty-eight or
thirty and not long married, and men of forty with
some money put by, will, in turn, understand how their
own class feels.</p>

<p>In ten minutes you had entered into the hearts of
this single company in a way that made you feel that
you had got into the heart of the whole French army.
When you asked them if they would like to go home
they didn’t say “No!” all in a chorus, as if that were
what the colonel had told them to say. They obey the
colonel, but their thoughts are their own. Otherwise,
these ruddy, healthy men, representing the people of
France and not the cafés of Paris, would not keep
France a republic.</p>

<p>Yes, they did want to go home. They did want to
go home. They wanted their wives and babies; they
wanted to sit down to morning coffee at their own
tables. Lumps rose in their throats at the suggestion.
But they were not going until the German peril was
over forever. Why stop now, only to have another
terrible war in thirty or forty years? A peace that
would endure must be won. They had thought that
out for themselves. They would not stick to their
determination if they had not. This is the way of
democracies. Thus every one was conscious that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
was fighting not merely to win, but for future generations.</p>

<p>“It happened that this great struggle which we had
long feared came in our day, and to us is the duty,”
said one. You caught the spirit of comradeship passing
the time with jests at one another’s expense. One
of the men who was not a full thirty-third degree <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilu</i>
had compromised with the razor on a moustache as
blazing red as his shock of hair.</p>

<p>“I think that the colonel gave him the tip that he
would light the way for the Zeppelins,” said a comrade.</p>

<p>“Envy! Sheer envy!” was the retort. “Look at
him!” and he pointed at some scraggly bunches on
chin and cheeks which resembled a young grass plat
that had come up badly.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in air-tight beards,” was the response.</p>

<p>When I produced a camera, the effect was the same
as it always is with soldiers at the front. They all
wanted to be in the photograph, on the chance that
the folks at home might see how the absent son or
father looked. Would I send them one? And the
address was like this: “Monsieur Benevent, Corporal
of Infantry, 18th Company, 5th Battalion,
299th Regiment of Infantry, Postal Sector No. 121,”
by which you will know the rural free delivery methods
along the French front. This address is the one rift
in the blank wall of anonymity which hides the individuality
of the millions under Joffre. Only the army
knows the sector and the number of the regiment in
that sector. By the same kind of a card-index system
Joffre might lay his hand on any one of his millions,
each a human being with all a human being’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
individual emotions, who, to be a good soldier, must
be only one of the vast multitude of obedient chessmen.</p>

<p>“We are ready to go after them when Father Joffre
says the word,” all agreed. Joffre has proved himself
to the democracy, which means the enthusiastic loyalty
of a democracy’s intelligence.</p>

<p>“If there are any homesick ones we should find
them among the lot here,” said <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mon capitaine</i>.</p>

<p>These were the men who had not been long married.
They were not yet past the honeymoon period; they
had young children at home; perhaps they had become
fathers since they went to war. The younger men of
the first line had the irresponsibility and the ardour of
youth which makes comradeship easy.</p>

<p>But the older men, the Territorials as they are
called, in the late thirties and early forties, have settled
down in life. Their families are established;
their careers settled; some of them, perhaps, may enjoy
a vacation from the wife, for you know madame, in
France, with all her thrift, can be a little bossy, which
is not saying that this is not a proper tonic for her
lord. So the old boys seem the most content in the
fellowship of winter quarters. What they cannot
stand are repeated, long, hard marches; their legs give
out under the load of rifle and pack. But their hearts
are in the war, and right there is one very practical
reason why they will fight well&mdash;and they have
fought better as they hardened with time and the old
French spirit revived in their blood.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Allons, messieurs!</i>” said the tall major, who
wanted us to see battle-fields. It required no escort to
tell us where the battle-field was. We knew it when
we came to it as you know the point reached by high<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
tide on the sands&mdash;this field where many Gettysburgs
were fought in one through that terrible fortnight in
late August and early September, when the future of
France and the whole world hung in the balance&mdash;as
the Germans sought to reach Paris and win a decisive
victory over the French army. Where destruction
ended there the German invasion reached its
limit.</p>

<p>Forests and streams and ditches and railroad culverts
played their part in tactical surprises, as they did
at Gettysburg; and cemetery walls, too. In all my
battle-field visits in Europe I have not seen a single
cemetery wall that was not loopholed. But the
fences, which throughout the Civil War offered impediment
to charges and screen to the troops which
could reach them first, were missing. The fields lay
in bold stretches, because it is the business of young
boys and girls in Lorraine to watch the cows and keep
them out of the corn.</p>

<p>We stopped at a crossroads where charges met and
wrestled back and forth in and out of the ditches.
Fragments of shells appeared as steps scuffed away
the thin coating of snow. I picked up an old French
cap, with a slash in the top that told how its owner
came to his end, and near by a German helmet. For
there are souvenirs in plenty lying in the young wheat
which was sown after the battle was over. Millions
of little nickel bullets are ploughed in with the blood of
those who died to take the Kaiser to Paris and those
who died to keep him out in this fighting across these
fields and through the forests, in a tug of war of give-and-take,
of men exhausted after nights and days
under fire, men with bloodshot eyes sunk deep in the
sockets, dust-laden, blood-spattered, with forty years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
of latent human powder breaking forth into hell when
the war was only a month old and passion was at a
white heat.</p>

<p>Hasty shelter trenches gridiron the land; such
trenches as breathless men, dropping after a charge,
threw up hurriedly with the spades that they carry on
their backs, to give them a little cover. And there is
the trench that stopped the Germans&mdash;the trench
which they charged but could not take. It lies among
shell-holes so thick that you can step from one to another.
In places its crest is torn away, which means
that half a dozen men were killed in a group. But
reserves filled their places. They kept pouring out
their stream of lead which German courage could not
endure. Thus far and no farther the invasion came
in that wheat-field which will be ever memorable.</p>

<p>We went up a hill once crowned by one of those
clusters of farm buildings of stone and mortar, where
house and stables and granaries are close together.
All around were bare fields. Those farm buildings
stood up like a mountain peak. The French had the
hill and lost it and recovered it. Whichever side had
it, the other was bound to bathe it in shells because it
commanded the country around. The value of property
meant nothing. All that counted was military
advantage. Because churches are often on hilltops,
because they are bound to be used for lookouts, is
why they get torn to pieces. When two men are
fighting for life they don’t bother about upsetting a
table with a vase, or notice any “Keep off the grass”
signs; no, not even if the family Bible be underfoot.</p>

<p>None of the roof, none of the superstructure of
these farm buildings was left; only the lower walls,
which were eighteen inches thick and in places penetrated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
by the shells. For when a Frenchman builds
a farmhouse he builds it to last a few hundred years.
The farm windmill was as twisted as a birdcage that
has been rolled under a trolley car, but a large hayrake
was unharmed. Such is the luck of war. I
made up my mind that if I ever got under shell-fire
I’d make for the hayrake and avoid the windmill.</p>

<p>Our tall major pointed out all the fluctuating positions
during the battle. It was like hearing a chess
match explained from memory by an expert. Words
to him were something precious. He made each one
count as he would the shots from his cannon. His
narrative had the lucidity of a terse judge reviewing
evidence. The battle-field was etched on his mind in
every important phase of its action.</p>

<p>Not once did he speak in abuse of the enemy. The
staff officer who directs steel ringing on steel is too
busy thrusting and keeping guard to indulge in diatribes.
To him the enemy is a powerful impersonal
devil who must be beaten. When I asked about the
conduct of the Germans in the towns they occupied,
his lip tightened and his eyes grew hard.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it was pretty bad!” he said; as if he
felt, besides the wrong to his own people, the shame
that men who had fought so bravely should act so ill.
I think his attitude toward war was this: “We will
die for France, but calling the Germans names will
not help us to win. It only takes breath.”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Allons, messieurs!</i>”</p>

<p>As our car ran up a gentle hill we noticed two
soldiers driving a load of manure. This seemed a
pretty prosaic, even humiliating, business, in a poetic
sense, for the brave <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilus</i>, veterans of Lorraine’s
great battle. But Father Joffre is a true Frenchman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
of his time. Why shouldn’t the soldiers help the
farmers whose sons are away at the front and perhaps
helping farmers back of some other point of the line?</p>

<p>Over the crest of the hill we came on long lines of
soldiers bearing timbers and fascines for trench building,
which explained why some of the villages were
empty. A fascine is something usually made of
woven branches which will hold dirt in position. The
woven wicker cases for shells which the German artillery
uses and leaves behind when it has to quit the field
in a hurry, make excellent fascines, and a number
that I saw were of this ready-made kind. After
carrying shells for killing Frenchmen they were to protect
the lives of Frenchmen. Near by other soldiers
were turning up a strip of fresh earth against the
snow, which looked like a rip in the frosting of a
chocolate cake.</p>

<p>“How do you like this kind of war?” we asked.
It is the kind that irrigationists and subway excavators
do.</p>

<p>“We’ve grown to be very fond of it,” was the answer.
“It is a cultivated taste, which becomes a passion
with experience. After you have been shot at in
the open you want all the earth you can get between
you and the bullets.”</p>

<p>Now we alighted from the automobile and went
forward on foot. We passed some eight lines of
trenches before we came to the one where we were
to stop. A practised military eye had gone over all
that ground; a practised military hand had laid out
each trench. After the work was done the civilian’s
eye could grasp the principle. If one trench were
taken, the men knew exactly how to fall back on the
next, which commanded the ground they had left.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
The trenches were not continuous. There were open
spaces left purposely. All that front was literally
locked, and double and triple locked, with trenches.
Break through one barred door and there is another
and another confronting you. Considering the millions
of burrowing and digging and watching soldiers,
it occurred to one that if a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">marmite</i> (saucepan) came
along and buried our little party, our loss would not be
as much noticed as if a piece of coping from a high
building had fallen and extinguished us on Broadway,
which would be a relatively novel way of dying. Being
killed in war had long ceased to be a novelty on
the continent of Europe.</p>

<p>We seemed in a dead world, except for the
leisurely, hoarse, muffled reports of a French gun in
the woods on either side of the open space where we
stood. Through our glasses we could see quite
clearly the line of the German front trench, which was
in the outskirts of a village on higher ground than the
French. Not a human being was visible. Both sides
were watching for any move of the other and meanwhile
lying tight under cover. By day they were
marooned. All supplies and all reliefs of men who
are to take their turn in front go out by night.</p>

<p>There were no men in the trench where we stood;
those who would man it in case of danger were in the
adjoining woods, where they had only to cut down saplings
and make shelters to be as comfortable as in a
winter resort camp in the Adirondacks. Any minute
they might receive a call&mdash;which meant death for
many. But they were used to that, and their card
games went on none the less merrily.</p>

<p>“No farther?” we asked our major.</p>

<p>“No farther!” he said. “This is risk enough for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
you. It looks very peaceful, but the enemy could toss
in some <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">marmites</i> if it pleased him.” Perhaps he was
exaggerating the risk for the sake of a realistic effect
on the sightseers. No matter! In time one was to
have risks enough in trenches. It was on such an occasion
as this, on another part of the French line, that
two correspondents slipped away from the officers conducting
them, though their word of honour was given
not to do so&mdash;which adds another reason for military
suspicion of the press. The officers rang up the
nearest telephone which connected with the front
trenches, the batteries, and regimental and brigade
headquarters, to apprehend two men of such-and-such
description. They were taken as easily as a one-eyed,
one-eared man, with a wooden leg and red hair, would
be in trying to get out of police headquarters when the
doorman had his Bertillon photograph and measurements
to go by.</p>

<p>That battery hidden from aerial observation in the
thick forest kept up its slow firing at intervals. It
was “bothering” one of the German trenches.
Fiendish the consistent regularity with which it kept
on, and so easy for the gunners. They had only to
slip in a shell, swing a breechlock home, and pull a
lanyard. The German guns did not respond because
they could not locate the French battery. They may
have known that it was somewhere in the forest, but
firing at two or three hundred acres of wood on the
chance of reaching some guns heavily protected by
earth and timbering was about like tossing a pea from
the top of the Washington Monument on the chance
of hitting a four-leafed clover on the lawn below.</p>

<p>Our little group remained, not standing in the
trench, but back of it in full relief for some time; for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
the German gunners refused to play for realism by
sending us a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">marmite</i>. Probably they had seen us
through the telescope at the start and concluded we
weren’t worth a shot. In the first months of the war
such a target would have received a burst of shells,
for the fun of seeing us scatter, if nothing else. Then
ammunition was plentiful and the sport of shooting
had not lost its zest; but in these winter days orders
were not to waste ammunition. The factories must
manufacture a supply ahead for the summer campaign.
There must be fifteen dollars’ worth of target in
sight, say, for the smallest shell costs that; and the
shorter you are of shells the more valuable the target
must be. Besides, firing a cannon had become as
commonplace a function to both French and German
gunners as getting up to put another stick of wood in
the stove or going to open the door to take a letter
from the postman.</p>

<p>We had glimpses of other trenches; but this is not
the place in this book to write of trenches. We shall
see trenches till we are weary of them later. We are
going direct to Gerbeviller, which was&mdash;emphasis on
the past tense&mdash;a typical little Lorraine town of fifteen
hundred inhabitants. Look where you would
now, as we drove along the road, and you saw churches
without steeples, houses with roofs standing on sections
of walls, houses smashed into bits.</p>

<p>“I saw no such widespread destruction as this in
Belgium!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“There was no such fighting in Belgium,” was the
answer.</p>

<p>Of course not, except in the southwestern corner,
where the armies still face each other.</p>

<p>“Not all the damage was done by the Germans,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
the major explained. “Naturally, when they were
pouring in death from the cover of a house, our guns
let drive at that house,” he went on. “The owners
of the houses that were hit by our shells are rather
proud&mdash;proud of our marksmanship, proud that we
gave the unwelcome guest a hot pill to swallow.”</p>

<p>For ten days the Bavarians had Gerbeviller. They
tore it to pieces before they got it, then burned the
remains because they said the population sniped at
them. All the orgy of Louvain was repeated here,
unchronicled to our people at home. The church
looks like a Swiss cheese from shell-holes. Its
steeple was bound to be an observation post, reasoned
the Germans; so they poured shells into it. But the
brewery had a tall chimney which was an even better
lookout, and the brewery is the one building unharmed
in the town. The Bavarians knew that they would
need that for their commissariat. For a Bavarian
will not fight without his beer. The land was littered
with barrels after they had gone. I saw some in
trenches occupied by Bavarian reserves not far back
of where their firing-line had been.</p>

<p>“However, the fact that the brewery is intact and
the church in ruins does not prove that a brewery is
better than a church. It only proves which is the
Lord’s side in this war,” said Sister Julie. But I get
ahead of my story.</p>

<p>In the middle of the main street were half a dozen
smoke-blackened houses which remained standing, an
oasis in the sea of destruction, with doors and windows
intact, facing gaps where doors and windows had
been. We entered with a sense of awe of the chance
which had spared these buildings.</p>

<p>“Sister Julie!” the major called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
A short, sturdy nun of about sixty years answered
cheerily and appeared in the dark hall. She led us
into the sitting-room, where she spryly placed chairs
for our little party. She was smiling; her eyes were
sparkling with a hospitable and kindly interest in us,
while I felt, on my part, that thrill of curiosity that
one always has when he meets some celebrated person
for the first time&mdash;a curiosity no less keen than if I
were to meet Barbara Frietchie.</p>

<p>Through all that battle of ten days, with the cannon
never silent day or night, with shells screaming
overhead and crashing into houses; through ten days
of thunder and lightning and earthquake, she and her
four sister associates remained in Gerbeviller. When
the town was fired they moved from one building to
another. They nursed both wounded French and
Germans, also wounded townspeople who could not
flee with the others.</p>

<p>“You were not frightened? You did not think of
going away?” she was asked.</p>

<p>“Frightened?” she answered. “I had not time
to think of that. Go away? How could I when the
Lord’s work had come to me?”</p>

<p>President Poincaré went in person to give her the
Legion of Honour, the first given to a woman in this
war; so rarely given to a woman, and here bestowed
with the love of a nation. Sister Marie was in the
kitchen at the time, very busy cooking the meal for
the sick whom the sisters are still caring for. So Sister
Julie took the President of France into the kitchen
to meet Sister Marie, quite as she would take you or
me. A human being is simply a human being to Sister
Julie, to be treated courteously; and great men may
not cause a meal for the sick to burn. After the complexity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
of French politics, President Poincaré was anything
but unfavourably impressed by the incident.</p>

<p>“He was such a little man, I could not believe at
first that he could be President,” she said. “I
thought that the president of France would be a big
man. But he was very agreeable and, I am sure, very
wise. Then there were other men with him, a Monsieur
de-de-Deschanel, who was president of something
or other in Paris, and Monsieur du-du&mdash;yes,
that was it, Du Bag. He also is president of something
in Paris. They were very agreeable, too.”</p>

<p>“And your Legion of Honour?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my medal that M. le Président gave me! I
keep that in a drawer. I do not wear it every day
when I am in my working clothes.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever been to Paris?”</p>

<p>“No, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“They will make a great ado over you when you
go.”</p>

<p>“I must stay in Gerbeviller. If I stayed during
the fighting and when the Germans were here, why
should I leave now? Gerbeviller is my home.
There is much to do here, and there will be more to
do when the people who were driven away return.”</p>

<p>These nuns saw their townspeople stood up against
a wall and shot; they saw their townspeople killed by
shells. The cornucopia of war’s horrors was emptied
at their door. And women of a provincial town, who
had led peaceful, cloistered lives, they did not blench
or falter in the presence of ghastliness which only men
are supposed to have the stoicism to witness.</p>

<p>What feature of the nightmare had held most vividly
in Sister Julie’s mind? It is hard to say; but the
one which she dwelt on was about the boy and the cow.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
The invaders, when they came in, ordered that no inhabitant
leave his house, on pain of death. A boy of
ten took his cow to pasture in the morning as usual.
He did not see anything wrong in that. The cow
ought to go to pasture. And he was shot, for he
broke a military regulation. He might have been a
spy using the cow as a blind. War does not bother to
discriminate. It kills.</p>

<p>Sister Julie can enjoy a joke, particularly on the
Germans, and her cheerful smile and genuine laugh
are a lesson to all people who draw long faces in time
of trouble and weep over spilt milk. A buoyant temperament
and unshaken faith carried her through her
ordeal. Though her hair is white, youth’s optimism
and confidence in the future and the joy of victory for
France overshadowed the present. The town and
church would be rebuilt; children would play in the
streets again; there was a lot of the Lord’s work to do
yet.</p>

<p>In every word and thought she is French&mdash;French
in her liveliness of spirit and quickness of comprehension;
wholly French there on the borderland of Germany.
If we only went to the outskirts of the town,
she reminded us, we could see how the soldiers of her
beloved France fought and why she was happy to have
remained in Gerbeviller to welcome them back.</p>

<p>In sight of that intact brewery and that wreck of a
church is a gentle slope of open field, cut by a road.
Along the crest were many mounds as thick as the
graves of a cemetery, and by the side of the road was
a temporary monument above a big mound, surrounded
by a sanded walk and a fence. The dead
had been thickest at this point, and here they had been
laid in a vast grave. The surviving comrades had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
made that monument; and, in memory of what the
dead had fought for, the living said that they were
not yet ready to quit fighting.</p>

<p>Standing on this crest, you were a thousand yards
away from the edge of a woods. German aeroplanes
had seen the French massing for a charge under the
cover of that crest; but French aeroplanes could not
see what was in the woods. Rifles and machine guns
poured a spray of lead across the crest when the
French appeared. But the French, who were fighting
for Sister Julie’s town, would not stop their rush at
first. They kept on, as Pickett’s men did when the
Federal guns riddled their ranks with grapeshot.
This accounts for many of the mounds being well beyond
the crest. The Germans made a mistake in firing
too soon. They would have made a heavier killing
if they had allowed the charge to go farther.
After the French fell back, for two days and nights
their wounded lay out on that field without water or
food, between the two forces, and if their comrades
approached to give succour the machine guns blazed
more death, because the Germans did not want to let
the French dig a trench on the crest. After two days
the French forced the Germans out of the woods by
hitting them from another point.</p>

<p>We went over the field of another charge half a
mile away. There a French regiment put a stream
with a single bridge at their back&mdash;which requires
some nerve&mdash;and charged a German trench on rising
ground. They took it. Then they tried to take the
woods beyond. Before they were checked twenty-two
officers out of a total of thirty fell. But they did
not give up the ground they had won. They burrowed
into the earth in a trench of their own, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
when help came they put the Germans out of the
woods.</p>

<p>The men of this regiment were not first line, but
the older fellows&mdash;men of the type we stopped to
chat with in the village&mdash;hastening to the front when
the war began. Their officers were mostly reserves,
too, who left their civil occupations at the call of arms.
One of the eight survivors of the thirty was with us,
a stocky little man, hardly looking the hero or the
soldier. I expressed my admiration, and he answered
quietly: “It was for France!” How often I have
heard that as a reason for courage or sacrifice! The
brave enemies of France have learned to respect it,
though they had a poor opinion of the French army
before the war began. “That railroad bridge yonder
the Germans left intact when they occupied it
because they were certain that they would need it to
supply their troops when they took the Gap of Mirecourt
and surrounded the French army,” I was told.
“However, they had to go in such a hurry that they
failed to mine it. They must have fired five hundred
shells afterward to destroy it, in vain.”</p>

<p>It was dusk when we entered the city of Lunéville
for the second time. Whole blocks lay in ruins;
others only showed where shells had crashed into
walls. It is hard to estimate just how much damage
shell-fire has done to a town, for you see the effects
only where they have struck on the street sides and not
when they strike in the centre of the block. But
Lunéville has certainly suffered as much as Louvain,
only we did not hear about it. Grim, sad Louvain,
with its sentries among the ruins! Happy, triumphant
Lunéville, with its <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poilus</i> instead of German sentries!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
“We are going to meet the mayor,” said the major.</p>

<p>First we went to his office. But that was a mistake.
We were invited to his house, which was a fine, old
eighteenth-century building. If you could transport it
to New York some arms-and-ammunition millionaire
would give half a million dollars for it. The hallway
was smoke-blackened and a burnt spot showed where
the enemy had tried to set it on fire before evacuating
the town. An ascent of a handsome old staircase and
we were in rooms with gilded mirrors and carved old
mantels, where we were introduced to His Honour, a
lively man of forty.</p>

<p>“I have been in Amerique two months. So much
English do I speak. No more!” said the mayor
merrily, and introduced us in turn to his wife, who
spoke not even “so much” English, but French as
fast and as piquantly as only a Frenchwoman can.
Her only son, who was seventeen, was going up with
the 1916 class of recruits very soon. He was a
sturdy youngster; a type of Young France who will
make the France of the future.</p>

<p>“You hate to see him go?” I asked.</p>

<p>“It is for France!” she answered.</p>

<p>We had cakes and tea and a merrier&mdash;at least, a
more heartfelt&mdash;party than at any mayor’s reception
in time of peace. Everybody talked. For the
French do know how to talk, when they have not
turned grim, silent soldiers. Foreigners say we do.
Maybe it is a democratic weakness. I heard story on
story of the German occupation, and how the mayor
was put in jail and held as hostage, and what a German
general said to him when he was brought in as a
prisoner to be interrogated in his own house, which
the general occupied as headquarters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
Among the guests was the wife of a French general
in her Red Cross cap. She might see her husband
once a week by meeting him on the road between the
city and the front. He could not afford to be any
farther from his post, lest the Germans spring a surprise.
The extent of the information which he gave
her was that all went well for France. Father Joffre
plays no favourites in his discipline.</p>

<p>Happy, happy Lorraine in the midst of its ruins!
Happy because her adored tricolour floats over those
ruins.</p></div>

<span class="subhead">A ROAD OF WAR I KNOW</span></h2>

<p>Other armies go to war across the land, but the British
go across the sea. They take the Channel ferry in
order to reach the front. Theirs is the home road of
war to me; the road of my affections, where men speak
my mother tongue. It begins on the platform at
Victoria Station, with the khaki of officers and men
returning from leave, relieved by the warmer colours
of women who have come to say good-bye to those
they love. In five hours from the time of starting
one may be across that ribbon of salt water, which
means much in isolation and little in distance, and in
the trenches.</p>

<p>That veteran regular&mdash;let us separate him from
the crowd,&mdash;is a type I have often seen, a type that
has become as familiar as one’s neighbours in one’s
own town. We will call him the tenth man. That is,
of every ten men who went to the front a year ago in
his battalion, nine are gone. All of the hardships and
all of the terrors of war he has witnessed: men
dropped neatly by a bullet; men mangled by shells.</p>

<p>His khaki is spotless, thanks to his wife, who has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
dressed in her best for the occasion. Terrible as war
itself, but new, that hat of hers, which probably represented
a good deal of looking into windows and pricing;
and her gown of the cheapest material, drooping
from her round shoulders, is the product of the poor
dressmaking skill of hands which show only too well
who does all the housework at home. The children,
a boy of four and a girl of seven, are in their best, too,
with faces scrubbed till they shine.</p>

<p>You will see like scenes in stations at home when the
father has found work in a distant city and is going on
ahead to get established before the family follow him.
Such incidents are common in civil life; they became
common at Victoria Station. What is common has
no significance, editors say.</p>

<p>When the time came to go through the gate, the veteran
picked the boy up in his arms and pressed him
very close and the little girl looked on wonderingly,
while the mother was not going to make it any harder
for the father by tears. “Good-bye, Tom!” she
said. So his name was Tom, this tenth man.</p>

<p>I spoke with him. His battalion was full with recruits.
It had been kept full. But, considering the
law of chance, what about the surviving one out of
an original ten?</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve had my luck with me,” he said. “Probably
my turn will come. Maybe I’ll never see the
wife and kids again.”</p>

<p>The morning roar of London had begun. That
station was a small spot in the city. There were not
enough officers and men taking the train to make up
a day’s casualty list; for ours was only a small party
returning from leave. The transports, unseen, carried
the multitudes. Wherever one had gone in England<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
he had seen soldiers and wherever he went in
France he was to see still more soldiers. England had
become an armed camp; and England plodded on,
“muddled” on, preparing, ever preparing, to forge
in time of war the thunderbolt for war which was undreamed
of in time of peace when other nations were
forging their thunderbolts.</p>

<p>Still the recruiting posters called for more soldiers
and the casualty lists appeared day after day with
the regularity of want advertisements. Imagine eight
million men under arms in the United States and you
have the equivalent to what England did by the volunteer
system. The more there were the more pessimistic
became the British press. Pessimism brought in
recruits. Bad news made England take another deep
breath of energising determination. It was the last
battle which was decisive. She had always won that.
She would win it again.</p>

<p>They talk of war aboard the Pullman, after officers
have waved their hands out of the windows to their
wives, quite as if they were going to Scotland for a
week-end instead of back to the firing-line. British
phlegm that is called. No, British habit, I should say,
the race-bred, individualistic quality of never parading
emotions in public, the instinct of keeping things
which are one’s own to one’s self. Personally, I like
this way. In one form or another, as the hedges fly
by the train windows, the subject is always war. War
creeps into golf, or shooting, or investments, or politics.
Only one suggestion quite frees the mind from
the omnipresent theme: Will the Channel be smooth?
The Germans have nothing to do with that. It is
purely a matter of weather. Bad sailors are more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
worried about the crossing than about the shell-fire
they are going to face.</p>

<p>With bad sailors or good sailors, the significant
thing which had become a commonplace was that the
Channel was a safely-guarded British sea lane. In
all my crossings I was never delayed. For England
had one thunderbolt ready forged when the war began.
The only submarines, or destroyers, or dirigibles that
one saw were hers. Antennæ these of the great fleet
waiting with the threat of stored lightning ready to be
flashed from gun-mouths; a threat as efficacious as
action, in nowise mysterious or subtle, but definite as
steel and powder, speaking the will of a people in
their chosen field of power, felt over all the seas of the
world, coast of Maine and the Carolinas no less than
Labrador. Thousands of transports had come and
gone, carrying hundreds of thousands of soldiers and
food for men and guns to India; and on the highroad
to India, to Australia, to San Francisco, shipping went
its way undisturbed by anything that dives or flies.</p>

<p>The same white hospital ships lying in that French
harbour; the same line of grey, dusty-looking ambulances
parked on the quay! Everybody in that one-time
sleepy, week-end tourist resort seems to be in uniform;
to have something to do with war. All surroundings
become those of war long before you reach
the front. That knot of civilians, waiting their turn
for another examination of the same kind as that on
the other side of the Channel, have shown good
reasons for going to Paris to the French consul in London,
or they might not proceed even this far on the
road of war. They seem outcasts&mdash;a humble lot in
the variegated costumes of the civil world&mdash;outcasts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
from the disciplined world in its pattern garb of
khaki. Their excuse for not being in the game is that
they are too old or that they are women. For now
the war has sucked into its vortex all who are strong
enough to fight.</p>

<p>A traveller might be a spy; hence all this red tape
for the many to catch the one in its mesh. Even this
red tape seems now to have become normal. War is
normal. It would seem strange to cross the Channel
in a time of peace; the harbour would not look like
itself with civilians not having to show their passports,
and without the white hospital ships, and the white-bearded
landing-officer at the foot of the gangway, and
the board held up with lists of names of officers who
have telegrams waiting for them.</p>

<p>For the civilians a yellow card of disembarkation
and for the military a white card. The officers and
soldiers walk off at once and the queue of civilians
waits. One civilian with a white card, who belongs
to no regiment, who is not even a chaplain or a nurse,
puzzles the landing-officer for a moment. But there is
something to go with it&mdash;a correspondent’s licence
and a letter from a general who looks after such
things. They show that you “belong”; and if you
don’t belong on the road of war you will not get far.
As well try to walk past the doorman and take a seat
in the United States Senate chamber during a session.</p>

<p>Most precious that magical piece of paper. I happen
to be the only American with one, unless he is in
the fighting line&mdash;which is one sure way to get to the
front. The price of all the opera boxes at the Metropolitan
will not buy it; and it is the passport to the welcoming
smile from an army chauffeur whom I almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
regard as my own. But its real value appears at the
outskirts of the city. There the dead line is drawn;
there the sheep are finally separated from the goats by
a French sentry guarding the winding passageway between
some carts, which have been in the same place
in the road for months.</p>

<p>The car spins over the broad, hard French road, in
a land where for many miles you see no signs of war,
until it turns into the grounds of a small château
opposite a village church. The proprietor of a dry-goods
store in a neighbouring city spends his summers
here; but this summer he is in town, because the press
wanted a place to live and he was good enough to rent
us his country place. So this is home, where the five
British and one American correspondents live and
mess. The expense of our cars costs us treble all the
rest of our expenses. They take us where we want to
go. We go where we please, but we may not write
what we please. We see something like a thousand
times more than we can tell. The conditions are such
as to make a news reporter throw up his hands and
faint. But if he had his unbridled way, one day he
might feel the responsibility for the loss of some hundreds
of British soldiers’ lives.</p>

<p>“It may be all right for war correspondents, but
it is a devil of a poor place for a newspaper man,” as
one editor said. Yet it is the only place where you
can really know anything about the war.</p>

<p>We become a part of the machinery of the great organisation
that encloses us in its regular processes.
No one in his heart envies the press officer, who holds
the blue pencil over us. He has to “take it both
going and coming.” He labours on our behalf and
sometimes we labour with him. The staff are willing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
enough to let us watch the army at work, but they do
not care whether or not we write about their war; he
wants us both to see it and to write about it. He tells
us some big piece of news, and then says: “That is
for yourselves; you may not write it.”</p>

<p>People do not want to read about the correspondents,
of course. They want to read what the correspondents
have to tell about the war; but the conditions
of our work are interesting because we are the
link between the army and the reading public. All
that it learns from actual observation of what the
army is doing comes through us.</p>

<p>We may not give the names of regiments and brigades
until weeks after a fight, because that will tell
the enemy what troops were engaged; we may not
give the names of officers, for that is glorifying one
when possibly another did his duty equally well. It is
the anonymity of the struggle that makes it all seem
distant and unreal&mdash;till the telegram comes from the
War Office to say that the one among the millions who
is dear to you is dead or wounded. Otherwise, it is a
torment of unidentified elements behind a curtain,
which is parted for an announcement of a gain or a
loss, or to give out a list of the fallen.</p>

<p>The world wants to read that Peter Smith led the
King’s Own Particular Fusiliers in a charge. It may
not know Peter Smith, but his name and that of his
regiment make the information seem definite. The
statement that a well-known millionaire yesterday
gave a million dollars to charity, or that a man in a
checked suit swam from the Battery to Coney Island,
is not convincing; nor is the fact that one private unnamed
held back the Germans with bombs in the traverse
of a trench for hours until help came. We at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
the front, however, do know the names; we meet the
officers and men. Ours is the intimacy which we may
not interpret except in general terms.</p>

<p>Every article, every despatch, every letter, passes
through the censor’s hand. But we are never told
what to write. The liberty of the press is too old an
institution in England for that. Always we may learn
why an excision is made. The purpose is to keep information
from the enemy. It is not like fighting
Boers or Filipinos, this war of walls of men who can
turn the smallest bit of information to advantage.</p>

<p>Intelligence officers speak of their work as piecing
together the parts of a jig-saw puzzle. What seems
a most innocent fact by itself may furnish the bit which
gives the figure in the picture its face. It does not
follow because you are an officer that you know what
may and what may not be of service to the enemy.</p>

<p>A former British officer who had become a well-known
military critic, in an account of a visit to the
front mentioned having seen a battle from a certain
church tower. Publication of the account was followed
by a tornado of shell-fire that killed and
wounded many British soldiers. Only a staff specialist,
trained in intelligence work and in constant touch
with the intelligence department, can be a safe censor.
At the same time, he is the best friend of the correspondent.
He knows what is harmless and what may
not be allowed. He wants the press to have as much
as possible. For the more the public knows about its
soldiers, the better the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">morale</i> of the people, which
reflects itself in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">morale</i> of the army.</p>

<p>The published casualty lists giving the names of
officers and men and their battalions is a means of
causing casualties. From a prisoner taken the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
learns what battalions were present at a given fight;
he adds up the numbers reported killed and wounded
and ascertains what the fight cost the enemy and, in
turn, the effect of the fire from his side. But the British
public demanded to see the casualty lists and
the British press were allowed to gratify the desire.
They appeared in the newspapers, of course, days
after the nearest relative of the dead or wounded man
had received official notification from the War Office.</p>

<p>Officers’ letters from the front, so freely published
earlier in the war, amazed experienced correspondents
by their unconscious indiscretions. The line officer
who had been in a fight told all that he saw. Twenty
officers doing the same along a stretch of front and the
jig-saw experts, plus what information they had from
spies, were in clover. Editors said: “But these men
are officers. They ought to know when they are imparting
military secrets.”</p>

<p>Alas, they do not know! It is not to be expected
that they should. Their business is to fight; the business
of other experts is to safeguard information.
For a long time the British army kept correspondents
from the front on the principle that the business of a
correspondent must be to tell what ought not to be
told. Yet they were to learn that the accredited correspondent,
an expert at his profession, working in
harmony with the experts of the staff, let no military
secrets pass.</p>

<p>At our mess we get the Berlin dailies promptly.
Soon after the Germans are reading the war correspondence
from their own front we are reading it, and
laughing at jokes in their comic papers and at cartoons
which exhibit John Bull as a stricken old ogre and
Britannia who Rules the Waves with the corners of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
her mouth drawn down to the bottom of her chin, as
she sees the havoc that von Tirpitz is making with submarines
which do not stop us from receiving our German
jokes regularly across the Channel.</p>

<p>Doubtless the German messes get their <cite>Punch</cite> and
the London illustrated weeklies regularly. In the
time that it took the English daily with the account of
the action seen from the church tower to reach Berlin
and the news to be wired to the front, the German
guns made use of the information. Neutral little Holland
is the telltale of both sides; the ally and the enemy
of all intelligence corps. Scores of experts in
jig-saw puzzles on both sides seize every scrap of
information and piece them together. Each time that
one gets a bit from a newspaper he is for a sharper
press censorship on his side and a more liberal one
on the other.</p>

<p>We six correspondents have our insignia, as must
every one who is free to move along the lines. By a
glance you may tell everybody’s branch and rank in
that complicated and disciplined world, where no man
acts for himself, but always on some one else’s orders.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know who they are? They are the
correspondents,” I heard a soldier say. “D. Chron.,
that’s the <cite>Daily Chronicle</cite>; M. Post, that’s the <cite>Morning
Post</cite>; D. Mail, that’s the <cite>Daily Mail</cite>. There’s
one with U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A. What paper is that?”</p>

<p>“It ain’t a paper,” said another. “It’s the States&mdash;he’s
a Yank!” The War Office put it on the
American cousin’s arm, and wherever it goes it seems
welcome. It may puzzle the gunners when the American
says, “That was a peach of a shot, right across
the pan!” or the infantry when he says, “It cuts no
ice!” and there is no ice visible in Flanders; he speaks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
about typhoid to the medical corps which calls it
enteric; and “fly-swatting” is a new word to the sanitarians,
who are none the less busily engaged in that
noble art. Lessons for the British in the “American
language” while you wait! In return, the American
is learning what a “stout-hearted thruster” and other
phrases mean in the Simon-pure English.</p>

<p>The correspondents are the spoiled spectators of the
army’s work; the itinerants of the road of war. Nobody
sees so much as we, because we have nothing to
do but to see. An officer looking at the towers of
Ypres cathedral, a mile away from the trench where
he was, said: “No, I’ve never been in Ypres. Our
regiment has not been stationed in that part of the
line.”</p>

<p>We have sampled all the trenches; we have studied
the ruins of Ypres with an archæologist’s eye; we
know the names of the estaminets of the villages, from
“The Good Farmer” to “The Harvester’s Rest”
and “The Good Cousin,” not to mention “The Omnibus
Stop” on the Cassell Hill. Madame who keeps
the hotel in the G.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Q. town knows me so well that
we wave hands to each other as I pass the door; and
the clerks in a certain shop have learned that the
American likes his fruit raw, instead of stewed in the
English fashion, and plenty of it, especially if it comes
from the South out of season, as it does from Florida
or California to pampered human beings at home,
who, if they could see as much of this war as I have
seen, would appreciate what a fortunate lot they are
to have not a ribbon of salt water but a broad sea full
of it, and the British navy, too, between them and the
thing on the other side of the zone of death.</p>

<p>G.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Q. means General Headquarters, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
B.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;F., which shows the way for your letters from
England, means British Expeditionary Force. The
high leading, the brains, of the army are theoretically
at G.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Q. That word theoretically is used advisedly
in view of opinion at other points. An officer
sent from G.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Q. to command a brigade had not
been long out before he began to talk about those confounded
one-thing-and-another fellows at G.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Q.
When he was at G.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Q., he used to talk about those
confounded one-thing-and-another fellows who commanded
corps, divisions, and brigades at the front.
The philosophers of G.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Q. smiled and the philosophers
of the army smiled&mdash;it was the old story
of the staff and the line; of the main office and the
branches. But the line did the most smiling to see
the new brigadier getting a taste of his own medicine.</p>

<p>G.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Q. directs the whole; here every department
of all that vast concern which supplies the hundreds
of thousands of men and prepares for the other hundreds
of thousands is focussed. The symbol of its
authority is a red band around the cap, which means
that you are a staff officer. No war at G.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Q., only
the driving force of war. It seems as far removed
from the front as the New York office of a string of
manufacturing plants.</p>

<p>If one follows a red-banded cap into a door he
sees other officers and clerks and typewriters, and a
sign which says that a department chief has his desk
in the drawing-room of a private house&mdash;where he
has had it for months. Go to one mess and you will
hear talk about garbage pails and how to kill flies; to
another, about hospitals and clearing stations for the
wounded; to another, about barbed wire, sandbags,
spades, timber, and galvanised iron&mdash;the engineers;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
to another, about guns, shells, rifles, bullets, mortars,
bombs, bayonets, and high explosives&mdash;the ordnance;
to another, about jam, bread, bacon, uniforms, iron
rations, socks, underclothes, canned goods, fresh beef,
and motor trucks&mdash;the Army Service Corps; to another,
about attacks, counter-attacks, and salients, and
about what the others are doing and will have to do&mdash;the
operations.</p>

<p>The chief of staff drives the eight-horse team. He
works sixteen hours a day. So do most of the others.
This is how you prove to the line that you have a
right to be at G.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Q. When you get to know
G.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Q. it seems like any other business institution.
Many are there who don’t want to be there; but they
have been found out. They are specialists, who know
how to do one thing particularly well and are kept
doing it. No use of growling that you would like a
“fighting job.”</p>

<p>G.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Q. is the main station on the road of war,
which hears the sound of the guns faintly. Beyond
is the region of all the activities that it commands,
up to the trenches, where all roads end and all efforts
consummate. One has seen dreary, flat lands of mud
and leafless trees become fair with the spring, the
growing harvests reaped, and the leaves begin to fall.
Always the factory of war was in the same place;
the soldiers billeted in the same villages; the puffs
of shrapnel smoke over the same belt of landscape;
the ruins of the same villages being pounded by high
explosives. Always the sound of guns; always the
wastage of life, as passing ambulances, the curtains
drawn, speed by, their part swiftly and covertly done.
The enormity of the thing holds the imagination; its
sure and orderly processes of an organised civilisation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
working at destruction win the admiration. There is
a thrill in the courage and sacrifice and the drilled
readiness of response to orders.</p>

<p>One is under varying spells. To-day he seems in
the midst of a fantastic world, whose horror makes
it impossible of realisation. To-morrow, as his car
takes him along a pleasant by-road among wheat-fields
where peasants are working and no soldier is
in sight, it is a world of peace, and one thinks that
he has mistaken the roar of a train for the distant
roar of gun-fire. Again, it seems the most real of
worlds, an exclusive man’s world, where nothing
counts but organised material force, and all those
cleanly, well-behaved men in khaki are a part of the
permanent population.</p>

<p>One sees the war as a colossal dynamo, where force
is perpetual like the energy of the sun. The war is
going on forever. The reaper cuts the harvest, but
another harvest comes. War feeds on itself, renews
itself. Live men replace the dead. There seems no
end to supplies of men. The pounding of the guns,
like the roar of Niagara, becomes eternal. Nothing
can stop it.</p></div>

<span class="subhead">TRENCHES IN WINTER</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>A trench must be “experienced”&mdash;Appearance of the trench&mdash;A
trench periscope&mdash;“One hundred and fifty yards away”&mdash;Imagination
at work&mdash;The dead wall opposite&mdash;Trench realism&mdash;A
genuine officer&mdash;A night excursion&mdash;General Mud&mdash;The
German flares&mdash;A house in a trench wall&mdash;Oozing walls&mdash;“A

<p>The difference between trench warfare in winter and
in summer is that between sleeping on the lawn in
March and in July. It was in the mud and winds of
March that I first saw the British front. The winds
were much like the seasonal winds at home; but the
Flanders mud is like no other mud, in the judgment of
the British soldier. It is mixed with glue. When I
returned to the front in June for a longer stay, the
mud had become clouds of dust that trailed behind
the automobile.</p>

<p>In March my eagerness to see a trench was that
of one from the Western prairies to get his first
glimpse of the ocean. Once I might go into a trench
as often as I pleased I became “fed up” with
trenches, as the British say. They did not mean much
more than an alley or a railroad cut. One came to
think of the average peaceful trench as a ditch where
some men were eating marmalade and bully beef and
looking across a field at some more men who were
eating sausage and “K.&nbsp;K.” bread, each party taking
care that the other did not see him.</p>

<p>Writers have served us trenches in every possible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
literary style that censorship will permit. Whoever
“tours” one is convinced that none of the descriptions
published heretofore has been adequate and
writes one of his own which will be final. All agree
that it is not like what they thought it was. But, despite
all the descriptions, the public still fails to visualise
a trench. You do not see a trench with your
eyes so much as with your mind and imagination.
That long line where all the powers of destruction
within man’s command are in deadlock has become a
symbol for something which cannot be expressed by
words. No one has yet really described a shell-burst,
or a flash of lightning, or Niagara Falls; and no
one will ever describe a trench. He cannot put any
one else there. He can only be there himself.</p>

<p>The first time that I looked over a British parapet
was in the edge of a wood. Board walks ran across
the spongy earth here and there; the doors of little
shanties with earth roofs opened on to those streets,
which were called Piccadilly and the Strand. I was
reminded of a pleasant prospector’s camp in Alaska.
Only everybody was in uniform and occasionally something
whished through the branches of the trees.
One looked up to see what it was and where it was
going, this stray bullet, without being any wiser.</p>

<p>We passed along one of the walks until we came
to a wall of sandbags&mdash;simply white bags about
three-quarters of the size of an ordinary pillowslip,
filled with earth and laid one on top of another like
bags of grain. You stood beside a man who had a
rifle laid across the top of the pile. Of course, you
did not wear a white hat or wave a handkerchief.
One does not do that when he plays hide-and-seek.</p>

<p>Or, if you preferred, you might look into a chip of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
glass, with your head wholly screened by the wall of
sandbags, which got a reflection from another chip of
glass above the parapet. This is the trench periscope;
the principle of all of them is the same. They
have no more variety than the fashions in knives,
forks and spoons on the dinner table.</p>

<p>One hundred and fifty yards away across a dead
field was another wall of sandbags. The distance is
important. It is always stated in all descriptions.
One hundred and fifty yards is not much. Only when
you get within forty or fifty yards have you something
to brag about. Yet three hundred yards may be
more dangerous than fifteen, if an artillery “hate”
is on.</p>

<p>Look for an hour and all you see is the wall of
sandbags. Not even a rabbit runs across that dead
space. The situation gets its power of suggestion
from the fact that there are Germans behind the other
wall&mdash;real, live Germans. They are trying to kill
the British on our side and we are trying to kill them;
and they are as coyly unaccommodating about putting
up their heads as we are. The emotion of the situation
is in the fact that a sharpshooter might send a
shot at your cap; he might smash a periscope; a shell
might come. A rifle cracks&mdash;that is all. Nearly
every one has heard the sound, which is no different
at the front than elsewhere. And the sound is the
only information you get. It is not so interesting as
shooting at a deer, for you can tell whether you hit
him or not. The man who fires from a trench is not
even certain whether he saw a German or not. He
shot at some shadow or object along the crest which
might have been a German head.</p>

<p>Thus, one must take the word of those present that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
there is any more life behind than in front of the
sandbags. However, if you are sceptical you may
have conviction by starting to crawl over the top of
the British parapet. After dark the soldiers will slip
over and bring your body back. It is this something
you do not see, this something the imagination visualises,
that convinces you that you ought to be considerate
enough of posterity to write the real description
of a trench. Look for an hour at that wall of
sandbags and your imagination sees more and more,
while your eye sees only sandbags. What does this
war mean to you? There it is; only you can describe
what this war means to you.</p>

<p>Many a soldier who has spent months in trenches
has not seen a German. I boast that I have seen real
Germans through my glasses. They were walking
along a road back of their trenches. It was most
fascinating. All the Germans I had ever seen in Germany
were not half so interesting. I strained my
eyes watching those wonderful beings as I might at
the first visiting party from Mars to earth. There
must have been at least ten out of the Kaiser’s millions.</p>

<p>In summer that wood had become a sylvan bower,
or a pastoral paradise, or a leafy nook, as you please.
The sun played through the branches in a patchwork;
flowers bloomed on the dirt roofs of the shanties,
and a swallow had a nest&mdash;famous swallow!&mdash;on
one of the parapets. True, it was not on the front
parapet; it was on the reserve. The swallow knew
what he was about. He was taking a reasonable
amount of risk and playing reasonably secure to get
a front seat, according to the ethics of the war correspondent.
The two walls of sandbags were in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
same place that they had been six months previously.
A little patching had been done after some shells had
hit the mark, though not many had come.</p>

<p>For this was a quiet corner. Neither side was interested
in stirring up the hornets’ nest. If a member
of Parliament wished to see what trench life was
like he was brought here, because it was one of the
safest places for a few minutes’ look at the sandbags
which Mr. Atkins stared at week in and week out.
Some Conservatives, however, in the case of Radical
members, would have chosen a different kind of trench
to show; for example, that one which was suggested
to me by the staff officer with the twinkle in his eye
in my best day at the front.</p>

<p>In want of an army pass to the front in order to
write your own description, then, put up a wall of
sandbags in a vacant lot and another one hundred
and fifty yards away and fire a rifle occasionally from
your wall at the head of a man on the opposite side,
who will shoot at yours&mdash;and there you are. If you
prefer the realistic to the romantic school and wish
to appreciate the nature of trench life in winter, find
a piece of wet, flat country, dig a ditch seven or eight
feet deep and stand in icy water looking across at
another ditch, and sleep in a cellar that you have dug
in the wall, and you are near understanding what Mr.
Atkins has been doing for his country. The ditch
should be cut zigzag in and out, like the lines binding
the squares of a checker-board; that makes more work
and localises the burst of shells.</p>

<p>Of course, the moist walls will be continually falling
in and require mending in a drenching, freezing
rain of the kind that the Lord visits on all who
wage war underground in Flanders. Incidentally, you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
must look after the pumps, lest the water rise to your
neck. For all the while you are fighting Flanders as
well as the Germans.</p>

<p>To carry realism to the limit of the Grand Guignol
school, then, arrange some bags of bullets with dynamite
charges on a wire, which will do for shrapnel;
plant some dynamite in the parapet, which will do
for high explosive shells that burst on contact; and
sink heavier charges of dynamite under your feet,
which will do for mines&mdash;and set them off, while you
engage some one to toss grenades and bombs at you.</p>

<p>Though scores of officers’ letters had given their
account of trench life with the vividness of personal
experience, I must mention my first trench in Flanders
in winter when, with other correspondents, I saw the
real thing under the guidance of the commanding officer
of that particular section, a slight, wiry man who
wore the ribbon of the Victoria Cross, won in another
war for helping to “save the guns.” He made seeing
trenches in the mud seem a pleasure trip. He
was the kind who would walk up to his ball as if he
knew how to play golf, send out a clean, fair, long
drive, and then use his iron as if he knew how to use
an iron, without talking about his game on the way
around or when he returned to the club-house.</p>

<p>Men could go into danger behind him without realising
that they were in danger; they could share hardship
without realising that there were any hardships.
Such as he put faith and backbone into soldiers by
their very manner; and if their professional training
equal their talents, when war comes they win victories.</p>

<p>Of course, we had rubber boots, electric torches,
and wore British warms, those short, thick coats which
accrue a modicum of mud for you to carry besides<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
what you are carrying on your boots. We walked
along a hard road in the dark toward an aurora
borealis of German flares, which popped into the sky
like Roman candles and burst in circles of light.
They seemed to be saying: “Come on! Try to
crawl up on us and play us a trick and our eyes will
find you and our marksmen will stop you. Come on!
We make the night into day, and watching never
ceases from our parapet.”</p>

<p>Occasional rifle-shots and a machine gun’s ter-rut
were audible from the direction of the jumping red
glare, which stretched right and left as far as the eye
could see. We broke off the road into a morass of
mud, as one might cross lots when he had lost his
way, and plunged on till the commanding officer said,
“We go in here!” and we descended into a black
chasm in the earth. The wonder was that any ditch
could be cut in soil which the rains had turned into
syrup. Mud oozed from the sandbags, through the
wire netting, and between the wood supports which
held the walls in place. It was just as bad over in
the German trenches. General Mud laid siege to
both armies. The field of battle where he gathered
his gay knights was a slough. His tug of war was
strife against landslides, rheumatism, pneumonia, and
frozen feet.</p>

<p>The soldier tries to kill his adversary; he tries to
prevent his adversary from killing him. He is as
busy in safeguarding as in taking life. While he
breathes, thinks, fights mud, he blesses as well as
curses mud. Mother Earth is still unconquerable.
In her bosom man still finds security; such security
that “dug in” he can defy at a hundred yards’ distance
rifles that carry death three thousand yards.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
She it is that has made the deadlock of the trenches
and plastered their occupants with her miry hands.</p>

<p>The C.&nbsp;O. lifted a curtain of bagging as you might
lift a hanging over an alcove bookcase, and a young
officer, rising from his blankets in his house in the
trench-wall to a stooping posture, said that all was
quiet. His uniform seemed fleckless. Was it possible
that he wore some kind of cloth which shed mud
spatters? He was another of the type of Captain
P&mdash;&mdash;, my host at Neuve Chapelle; a type formed on
the type of seniors such as his C.&nbsp;O. Unanalysable
this quality, but there is something distinguished about
it and delightfully appealing. A man who can be the
same in a trench in Flanders in midwinter as in a
drawing-room has my admiration. They never lose
their manner, these English officers. They carry it
into the charge and back in the ambulance with them
to England, where they wish nothing so much as that
their friends will “cut out the hero stuff,” as our own
officers say.</p>

<p>In other dank cellars soldiers who were off guard
were lying or sitting. The radiance of the flares
lighted the profiles of those on guard, whose faces
were half hidden by coat collars or ear-flaps&mdash;imperturbable,
silent, marooned and marooning, watchful
and fearless. The thing had to be done and they
were doing it; and they were going to keep on doing
it.</p>

<p>There was nothing dry in that trench, unless it was
the bowl of a man’s pipe. There were not even any
braziers. In your nostrils was the odour of the soil
of Flanders, cultivated by many generations through
many wars. As night wore on the sky was brightened
by cold, winter stars and their soft light became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
noticeable between the disagreeable flashes of the
flares.</p>

<p>We walked on and on. It was like walking in a
winding ditch; that was all. The same kind of walls
at every turn; the same kind of dim figures in saturated,
heavy army overcoats. Slipping off the board
walk into the ooze, one was thrown against the mud
wall as his foot sank. Then he held fast to his boot
straps lest the boot remain in the mud while his foot
came out. Only the C.&nbsp;O. never slipped. He knew
how to tour trenches. The others were as clumsy
beside him as if they were trying to walk a tight
rope.</p>

<p>“Good night!” he said to each group of men as
he passed, with the cheer of one who brings a confident
spirit to vigils in the mud and with that note
of affection of the commander who has learned to
love his men by the token of ordeals when he saw
them hold fast against odds.</p>

<p>“Good night, sir!” they answered; and in their
tone was something which you liked to hear&mdash;a finer
tribute to the C.&nbsp;O. than medals which kings can bestow.
It was affection and trust. They were ready
to follow him, for they knew that he knew how to
lead. I was not surprised when I heard of his promotion,
later. I shall not be surprised when I hear
of it again. For he had brain and heart and the
gift of command.</p>

<p>“Shall we go on or shall we go back?” he asked
when we had gone about a mile. “Have you had
enough?”</p>

<p>We had, without a dissenting voice. A ditch in the
mud&mdash;that was all, no matter how much farther we
went. So we passed out of the trench into a soapy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
slippery mud which had been ploughed ground in the
autumn, now become lathery with the beat of men’s
steps. Our party became separated, when some
foundered and tried to hoist themselves with both
boot straps at once. The C.&nbsp;O. called out in order to
locate us in the darkness, and the voice of an officer
in the trenches cut in: “Keep still! The Germans
are only a hundred yards away!”</p>

<p>“Sorry!” whispered the C.&nbsp;O. “I ought to have
known better.”</p>

<p>Then one of the German searchlights that had been
swinging its stream of light across the paths of the
flares lay its fierce, comet eye on us, glistening on the
froth-streaked mud and showing each mud-splashed
figure in heavy coat in weird silhouette.</p>

<p>“Stand still!”</p>

<p>That is the order whenever searchlights come spying
in your direction. So we stood still in the mud,
looking at one another and wondering. It was the
one tense second of the night, which lifted our
thoughts out of the mud with the elation of risk.
That searchlight was the eye of death looking for a
target. With the first crack of a bullet we should
have known that we were discovered and that it was
no longer good tactics to stand still. We should have
dropped on all fours into the porridge. The searchlight
swept on. Perhaps Hans at the machine gun
was nodding or perhaps he did not think us worth
while. Either supposition was equally agreeable to
us.</p>

<p>We kept moving our mud-poulticed feet forward,
with the flares at our backs, till we came to a road
where we saw dimly a silent company of soldiers
drawn up and behind them the supplies for the trench.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
Through the mud and under cover of darkness every
bit of barbed wire, every board, every ounce of food,
must go up to the moles in the ditch. The searchlights
and the flares and the machine guns waited for
the relief. They must be fooled. But in this operation
most of the casualties in the average trenches,
both British and German, occurred. Without a
chance to strike back, the soldier was shot at by an
assassin in the night.</p>

<p>When the men who had been serving their turn of
duty in the trenches came out, a magnet drew their
weary steps&mdash;cleanliness. They thought of nothing
except soap and water. For a week they need not
fight mud or Germans or parasites, which, like General
Mud, waged war against both British and Germans.
Standing on the slats of the concrete floor
of a factory, they peeled off the filthy, saturated outer
skin of clothing with its hideous, crawling inhabitants
and, naked, leapt into great, steaming vats, where they
scrubbed and gurgled and gurgled and scrubbed.
When they sprang out to apply the towels, they were
men with the feel of new bodies in another world.</p>

<p>Waiting for them were clean clothes, which had
been boiled and disinfected; and waiting, too, was
the shelter of their billets in the houses of French
towns and villages, and rest and food and food and
rest, and newspapers and tobacco and gossip&mdash;but
chiefly rest and the joy of lethargy as tissue was rebuilt
after the first long sleep, often twelve hours at
a stretch. They knew all the sensations of physical
man, man battling with nature, in contrasts of exhaustion
and danger and recuperation and security, as the
pendulum swung slowly back from fatigue to the glow
of strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
Those who came out of the trenches quite “done
up,” Colonel Bate, Irish and genial, fatherly and not
lean, claimed for his own. After the washing they lay
on cots under a glass roof, and they might play dominoes
and read the papers when they were well enough
to sit up. They had the food which Colonel Bate
knew was good for them, just as well as he knew what
was deadly for the inhabitants whom they brought into
that isolated room which every man must pass through
before he was admitted to the full radiance of the
colonel’s curative smile. When they were able to return
to the trenches, each was written down as one
unit more in the colonel’s weekly statistical reports.
In summer he entertained <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">al fresco</i> in an open air

<span class="subhead">IN NEUVE CHAPELLE</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>British advance&mdash;The human stone wall moves&mdash;Neuve Chapelle
“on the map”&mdash;The travelled British army&mdash;A demolished
trench&mdash;Stray bullets&mdash;The intelligence system&mdash;A captured
spy&mdash;Old friends&mdash;Power of the British artillery&mdash;Front line

<p>Typical of many others, this quiet village in a flat
country of rich farming land, with a church, a school,
a post-office, and stores where the farmers could buy a
pound of sugar or a spool of thread, employ a notary,
or get a pair of shoes cobbled or a horse shod, without
having to go to the neighbouring town of Béthune,
Neuve Chapelle became famous only after it had
ceased to exist&mdash;unless a village remains a village
after it has been reduced to its original elements by
shell-fire.</p>

<p>It was the scene of one of those actions in the long
siege line which have the dignity of a battle; the
losses on either side, about sixteen thousand, were
two-thirds of those at Waterloo or Gettysburg.
Here the British after the long winter’s stalemate in
the mud, where they stuck when the exhausted Germans
could press them no farther, took the offensive,
with the sap of spring rising in their veins.</p>

<p>The guns blazed the way and the infantry charged
in the path of the guns’ destruction; and they kept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
on while the shield of shell-fire held. When it left
an opening for the German machine guns through its
curtain and the German guns visited on the British
what their guns had been visiting on the Germans,
the British stopped. A lesson was learned; a principle
established. A gain was made, if no goal were
reached.</p>

<p>The human stone wall had moved. It had broken
some barriers and come to rest before others, again
to become a stone wall. But it knew that the thing
could be done with guns and shells enough&mdash;and only
with enough. This means a good deal when you have
been under dog for a long time. Months were to
pass waiting for enough shells and guns, with many
little actions and their steady drain of life, while every
one looked back to Neuve Chapelle as a landmark.
It was something definite for a man to say that he
had been wounded at Neuve Chapelle and quite indefinite
to say that he had been wounded in the course
of the day’s work in the trenches.</p>

<p>No one might see the battle in that sea of mud.
He might as well have looked at the smoke of Vesuvius
with an idea of learning what was going on inside
of the crater. I make no further attempt at
describing it. My view came after the battle was
over and the cauldron was still steaming.</p>

<p>Though in March, 1914, one would hardly have
given Neuve Chapelle, intact and peaceful, a passing
glance from an automobile, in March, 1915, Neuve
Chapelle in ruins was the one town in Europe which
I most wanted to see. Correspondents had not then
established themselves. The staff officer whom I
asked if I might spend a night in the new British line
was a cautious man. He bade me sign a paper freeing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
the British army from any responsibility. Judging
by the general attitude of the Staff, one could
hardly take the request seriously. One correspondent
less ought to please any Staff; but he said that he had
an affection for the regulars and knew that there were
always plenty of recruits to take their places without
resorting to conscription. The real responsibility was
with the Germans. He suggested that I might go
out to the German trenches and see if I could obtain
a paper from them. He thought if I were quick
about it I might get at least a yard in front of the
British parapet in daylight. His sense of humour
I had recognised when we had met in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>Any traveller is bound to meet men whom he has
met before in the travelled British army. At the
brigade headquarters town, which, as one of the officers
said, proved that bricks and mortar can float in
mud, the face of the brigadier seemed familiar to
me. I found that I had met him in Shanghai in the
Boxer campaign, when he had come across a riotous
China from India on one of those journeys in remote
Asia which British officers are fond of making.
He was “all there,” whether dealing with a mob of
Orientals or with Germans in the trenches. I made
myself at home in the parlour of the private house
occupied by himself and staff, while he went on with
his work. No flag outside the house; no sign that it
was Headquarters. An automobile stopped in front
only long enough for an officer to enter it or alight
from it. Brigade headquarters is precisely the target
that German aeroplanes or spies like to locate
for their guns.</p>

<p>“Are you ready? Have you your rubber boots?”
the brigadier asked a few minutes later, as he put his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
head in at the parlour door. It would not do to approach
the trenches until after dark. Of course, I
had rubber boots. One might as well try to go to
sea without a boat as to trenches without rubber
boots in winter. “I’ll take my constitutional,” he
added; “the trouble with this kind of war is that
you get no exercise.”</p>

<p>He was a small man, but how he could walk! I
began to understand why the Boxers could not catch
him. He turned back after we had gone a mile or
more and one of his staff went on with me to a point
where, just at dusk, I was turned over to another
pilot, an aide from battalion headquarters, and we set
out across sodden fields that had yielded beet root in
the last harvest, taking care not to step in shell-holes.
Dusk settled into darkness. No human being was in
sight except ourselves.</p>

<p>“There’s the first line of German trenches before
the attack,” said my companion. “Our guns got
fairly on them.” Dimly I saw what seemed like a
huge, long, irregular furrow of earth which had been
torn almost out of the shape of a trench by British
shells. “There was no living in it when the guns
began all together. The only thing to do was to
get out.”</p>

<p>Around us was utter silence, where the hell of
thunders and destruction by the artillery had raged
during the battle. Then a spent or ricochet bullet
swept overhead, with the whistle of complaint of
spent bullets at having travelled far without hitting
any object. It had gone high over the British
trenches; it had carried the full range; and the chance
of its hitting any one was ridiculously small. But the
nearer you get to the trenches, the more likely these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
strays are to find a victim. “Hit by a stray bullet!”
is a very common saying at the front.</p>

<p>At last we felt the solidity of a paved road under
our feet, and following this we came to a peasant’s
cottage. Inside, two soldiers were sitting beside telephone
and telegraph instruments, behind a window
stuffed with sandbags. On our way across the fields
we had stepped on wires laid on the ground; we had
stooped to avoid wires stretched on poles&mdash;the wires
that form the web of the army’s intelligence.</p>

<p>Of course, no two units of communication are dependent
on one wire. There is always a duplicate.
If one is broken it is immediately repaired. The
factories spin out wire to talk over and barbed wire
for entanglements in front of trenches and weave
millions of bags to be filled with sand for breastworks
to protect men from bullets. If Sir John French
wished, he could talk with Lord Kitchener in London
and this battalion headquarters at Neuve Chapelle
within the same space of time that a railroad president
may speak over the long distance from Chicago to
New York and order dinner out in the suburbs.</p>

<p>These two men at the table, their faces tanned by
exposure, men in the thirties, had the British regular
of long service stamped all over them. War was an
old story to them; and an old story, too, laying signal
wires under fire.</p>

<p>“We’re very comfortable,” said one. “No danger
from stray bullets or from shrapnel; but if one
of the Jack Johnsons come in, why, there’s no more
cottage and no more argument between you and me.
We’re dead and maybe buried, or maybe scattered
over the landscape, along with the broken pieces of
the roof.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
A soldier was on guard with bayonet fixed inside
that little room, which had passageway to the cellar
past the table, among straw beds. This seemed
rather peculiar. The reason lay on one of the beds
in a private’s khaki. He had come into this battalion’s
trenches from our front and said that he belonged
to the D&mdash;&mdash; regiment and had been out on
patrol and lost his way.</p>

<p>It was two miles to that regiment and two miles
is a long distance to stray between two lines of trenches
so close together, when at any point in your own line
you will find friends. It was possible that this fellow’s
real name was Hans Schmidt, who had learned
cockney English in childhood in London, and in a
dead British private’s uniform had come into the British
trenches to get information to which he was anything
but welcome. He was to be sent under guard
to the D&mdash;&mdash; regiment for identification; and if he
were found to be a Hans and not a Tommy&mdash;well,
though he had tried a very stupid dodge he must have
known what to expect when he was found out, if his
officers had properly trained him in German rules of
war.</p>

<p>I had a glimpse of him in the candlelight before
stooping to feel my way down three or four narrow
steps to the cellar, where the farmer ordinarily kept
potatoes and vegetables. There were straw beds
around the walls here, too. The major commanding
the battalion rose from his seat at a table on which
were some cutlery, a jam pot, tobacco, pipes, a newspaper
or two, and army telegraph forms and maps.</p>

<p>If the hosts of mansions could only make their hospitality
as simple as the major’s, there would be less
affectation in the world. He introduced me to an officer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
sitting on the other side of the table and to one
lying in his blankets against the wall, who lifted his
head and blinked and said that he was very glad to
see me.</p>

<p>It is a small world, for China cropped up here, as
it had at brigade headquarters. The major had been
in garrison at Peking when the war began. If my
shipmate on a long battleship cruise, Lt.-Col. Dion
Williams, U.S.M.C., reads this out in Peking, let it
tell him that the major is just as urbane in the cellar
of a second-rate farmhouse on the outskirts of Neuve
Chapelle as he would be in a corner of the Peking
Club.</p>

<p>“How is it? Paining you any?” asked the major
of Captain P&mdash;&mdash;, on the other side of the table.</p>

<p>“No account. It’s quite all right,” said the captain.</p>

<p>“Using the sling?”</p>

<p>“Part of the time. Hardly need it, though.”</p>

<p>Captain P&mdash;&mdash; was one of those men whose eyes are
always smiling; who seems, wherever he is, to be glad
that he is not in a worse place; who goes right on
smiling at the mud in the trenches and bullets and
shells and death. They are not emotional, the British,
perhaps, but they are given to cheeriness, if not to
laughter, and they have a way of smiling at times
when smiles are much needed. The smile is more
often found at the front than back at Headquarters;
or perhaps it is more noticeable there.</p>

<p>“You see, he got a bullet through the arm yesterday,”
the major explained. “He was reported
wounded, but remained on duty in the trench.” I saw
that the captain would rather not have publicity given
to such an ordinary incident. He did not see why<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
people should talk about his arm. “You are to go
with him into the trench for the night,” the major
added; and I thought myself very lucky in my companion.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to have dinner with us?” the
major asked him.</p>

<p>“Why, I had something to eat not very long ago,”
said Captain P&mdash;&mdash;. One was not sure whether he
had or not.</p>

<p>“There’s plenty,” said the major.</p>

<p>“In that event, I don’t see why I shouldn’t eat when
I have a chance,” the captain returned; which I found
was a characteristic trench habit, particularly in winter
when exposure to the raw, cold air calls for plenty
of body-furnace heat.</p>

<p>We had a ration soup and ration ham and ration
prunes and cheese; what Tommy Atkins gets. When
we were outside the house and starting for the trench,
this captain, with his wounded arm, wanted to carry
my knapsack. He seemed to think that refusal was
breaking The Hague conventions.</p>

<p>Where we turned off the road, broken finger-points
of brick walls in the faint moonlight indicated the
site of Neuve Chapelle; other fragments of walls in
front of us were the remains of a house; and that
broken tree-trunk showed what a big shell can do.
The trunk, a good eighteen inches in diameter, had
not only been cut in two by one of the monsters of the
new British artillery, but had been carried on for ten
feet and left lying solidly in the bed of splinters of
the top of the stump. All this had been in the field
of that battle of a day, which was as fierce as the
fiercest day at Gettysburg and fought within about
the same space. Every tree, every square rod of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
ground, had been paid for by shells, bullets, and human
life.</p>

<p>But now we were near the trenches; or, rather,
the breastworks. We are always speaking of the
trenches, while not all parts of the line are held by
trenches. A trench is dug in the ground; a breastwork
is raised from the level of the ground. At some
points a trench becomes practically a breastwork, as
its wall is raised to get free of the mud and water.</p>

<p>We came into the open and heard the sound of
voices and saw a spotty white wall; for some of the
sandbags of the new British breastworks still retained
their original colour. On the reverse side of this
wall rifles were leaning in readiness, their fixed bayonets
faintly gleaming in the moonlight. I felt of
the edge of one and it was sharp, quite prepared for
business. In the surroundings of damp earth and
mud-bespattered men, this rifle seemed the cleanest
thing of all, meticulously clean, that ready weapon
whose well-aimed and telling fire, in obedient and
cool hands, was the object of all the drill of the new
infantry in England; of all the drill of all infantry.
Where pickets watched in the open in the old days before
armies met in pitched battle, an occasional soldier
now stands with rifle laid on the parapet, watching.</p>

<p>Across a reach of field faintly were made out the
white spots of another wall of breastworks, the German,
at the edge of a stretch of woods, the Bois du
Bies. The British reached these woods in their advance;
but, their aeroplanes being unable to spot the
fall of shells in the mist, they had to fall back for
want of artillery support. Along this line where we
stood outside the village they stopped; and to stop is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
to set the spades going to begin the defences which,
later, had risen to a man’s height, and with rifles and
machine guns had riddled the German counter-attack.</p>

<p>And the Germans had to go back to the edge of the
woods, where they, too, began digging and building
their new line. So the enemies were fixed again behind
their walls of earth, facing each other across the
open, where it was death for any man to expose himself
by day.</p>

<p>“Will you have a shot, sir?” one of the sentries
asked me.</p>

<p>“At what?”</p>

<p>“Why, at the top of the trench over there, or at
anything you see moving,” he said.</p>

<p>But I did not think that it was an invitation for a
non-combatant to accept. If the bullet went over the
top of the trench it had still two thousand yards and
more to go, and it might find a target before it died.
So, in view of the law of probabilities, no bullet is
quite waste.</p>

<p>“Now, which is my house?” asked Captain P&mdash;&mdash;.
“I really can’t find my own home in the dark.”</p>

<p>Behind the breastwork were many little houses
three or four feet in height, all of the same pattern,
and made of boards and mud. The mud is put on top
to keep out shrapnel bullets.</p>

<p>“Here you are, sir!” said a soldier.</p>

<p>Asking me to wait until he made a light, the captain
bent over as if he were about to crawl under the
top rail of a fence and his head disappeared. After
he had put a match to a candle and stuck it on a stick
thrust into the wall, I could see the interior of his
habitation. A rubber sheet spread on the moist earth
served as floor, carpet, mattress, and bed. At a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
squeeze there was room for two others besides himself.
They did not need any doormat, for when they
lay down their feet would be at the door.</p>

<p>“Quite cosy, don’t you think?” remarked the captain.
He seemed to feel that he had a royal chamber.
But, then, he was the kind of man who might sleep in
a muddy field under a wagon and regard the shelter
of the wagon body as a luxury. “Leave your knapsack
here,” he continued, “and we’ll go and see what
is doing along the line.”</p>

<p>In other words, after you had left your bag in the
host’s hall, he suggested a stroll in the village or across
the fields. But only to see war would he have asked
you to walk in such mud.</p>

<p>“Not quite so loud!” he warned a soldier who
was bringing up boards from the rear under cover of
darkness. “If the Germans hear they may start firing.”</p>

<p>Two other men were piling mud on top of a section
of breastwork at an angle to the main line.</p>

<p>“What is that for?” the captain asked.</p>

<p>“They get an enfilade on us here, sir, and Mr.
&mdash;&mdash; (the lieutenant) told me to make this higher.”</p>

<p>“That’s no good. A bullet will go right through,”
said the captain. “We’ll have to wait until we get
more sandbags.”</p>

<p>A little farther on we came to an open space, with
no protection between us and the Germans. Half a
dozen men were piling earth against a staked chicken
wire to extend the breastworks. Rather, they were
piling mud, and they were besmirched from head to
foot. They looked like reeking Neptunes rising from
a slough. In the same position in daylight, standing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
full height before German rifles at three hundred
yards, they would have been shot dead before they
could leap to cover.</p>

<p>“How does it go?” asked the captain.</p>

<p>“Very well, sir; though what we need is sandbags.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have some up to-morrow.”</p>

<p>At the moment there was no firing in the vicinity.
Faintly I heard the Germans pounding stakes, at
work improving their own breastworks.</p>

<p>A British soldier appeared out of the darkness in
front.</p>

<p>“We’ve found two of our men out there with their
heads blown off by shells,” he said. “Have we permission
to go out and bury them, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>They would be as safe as the fellows piling mud
against the chicken wire, unless the Germans opened
fire. If they did, we could fire on their working
party, or in the direction of the sound. For that
matter, we knew through our glasses by day the location
of any weak places in their breastworks and they
knew where ours were. A sort of “after-you-gentlemen-if-you-fire-we-shall”
understanding sometimes exists
between the foes up to a certain point. Each
side understands instinctively the limitation of that
point. Too much noise in working; a number of
men going out to bury dead or making enough noise
to be heard, and the ball begins. A deep, broad
ditch filled with water made a break in our line. No
doubt a German machine gun was trained on it.</p>

<p>“A little bridging is required here,” said the captain.
“We’ll have it done to-morrow night. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
break is no disadvantage if they attack; in fact, we’d
rather like to have them try for it. But it makes
movement along the line difficult by day.”</p>

<p>When we were across and once more behind the
breastworks, he called my attention to some high
ground in the rear.</p>

<p>“One of our officers took a short cut across there
in daylight,” he said. “He was quite exposed and
they drew a bead on him from the German trench
and got him through the arm. Not a serious hit.
It wasn’t cricket for any one to go out to bring him
in. He realised this and called out to leave him to
himself, and crawled to cover on his hands and knees.”</p>

<p>I was getting the commonplaces of trench life.
Thus far it had been a quiet night and was to remain
so. Reddish, flickering swaths of light were thrown
across the fields between the trenches by the enemy’s
Roman candle flares. One tried to estimate how
many flares the Germans must use every night from
Switzerland to the North Sea.</p>

<p>On our side, the only light was from our braziers.
Thomas Atkins has become a patron of braziers made
by punching holes in buckets; and so have the Germans.
Punch holes in a bucket, start a fire inside,
and you have cheer and warmth and light through the
long night vigils. Two or three days before we had
located a sniper between the lines by seeing him swing
his fire pot to make a draft against the embers.</p>

<p>If you have ever sat around a campfire in the forest
or on the plains you need be told nothing further.
One of the old, glamourous features of war survives
in these glowing braziers, spreading their genial rays
among the little houses and lighting the faces of the
men who stand or squat in encircling groups around<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
the coals, which dry wet clothes, slake the moisture of
a section of earth, make the bayonets against the walls
glisten, and reveal the position of a machine gun with
its tape ready for firing.</p>

<p>Values are relative, and a brazier in the trenches
makes the satisfaction of a steam-heated room in winter
very superficial and artificial. You are at home
there with Tommy Atkins, regular of an old line English
regiment, in his heavy khaki overcoat and solid
boots and wool puttees, a sturdy, hardened man of
a terrific war. He, the regular, the shilling-a-day
policeman of the empire, was still doing the fighting
at the front. The new army, which embraces all
classes, was not yet in action.</p>

<p>This man and that one were at Mons. This one
and that one had been through the whole campaign
without once seeing Mother England for whom they
were fighting. The affection in which Captain P&mdash;&mdash;
was held extended through his regiment, for we had
left his own company behind. At every turn he was
asked about his arm.</p>

<p>“You’ve made a mistake, sir. This isn’t a hospital,”
as one man expressed it. Oh, but the captain
was bored with hearing about that arm! If he is
wounded again I am sure that he will try to keep the
fact a secret.</p>

<p>These veterans could “grouse,” as the British call
it. Grousing is one of Tommy’s privileges. When
they got to grousing worst on the retreat from Mons,
their officers knew that what they really wanted was
to make another stand. They were tired of falling
back; they meant to take a rest and fight a while.
Their language was yours, the language in which our
own laws and schoolbooks are written. They made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
the old blood call. For months they had been taking
bitter medicine; very bitter for a British soldier.
The way they took it will, perhaps, remain a greater
tribute than any part they play in future victories.</p>

<p>“How do they feel in the States?” I was asked.
“Against us?”</p>

<p>“No. By no means.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how they could be!” Tommy exclaimed.</p>

<p>Tommy may not be much on argument as it is developed
by the controversial spirit of college professors,
but he had said about all there was to say. How
can we be? Hardly, after you come to know T.
Atkins and his officers and talk English with them
around their campfires.</p>

<p>“The Germans are always sending up flares,” I
remarked. “You send up none. How about it?”</p>

<p>“It cheers them. They’re downhearted!” said
one of the group. “You wouldn’t deny them their
fireworks, would you, sir?”</p>

<p>“That shows who is top dog,” said another.
“They’re the ones that are worried.”</p>

<p>I had heard of trench exhaustion, trench despair,
but there was no sign of it in a regiment that had
been through all the hell and mire that the British
army had known since the war began. To no one
had Neuve Chapelle meant so much as to these common
soldiers. It was their first real victory. They
were standing on soil won from the Germans.</p>

<p>“We’re going to Berlin!” said a big fellow who
was standing, palms downward to the fire. “It’s settled.
We’re going to Berlin.”</p>

<p>A smaller man with his back against the sandbags
disagreed. There was a trench argument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
“No, we’re going to the Rhine,” he said. “The
Russians are going to Berlin.” (This was in March,
1915, remember.)</p>

<p>“How can they when they ain’t over the Balkans
yet?”</p>

<p>“The Carpathians, you mean.”</p>

<p>“Well, they’re both mountains and the Russians
have got to cross them. And there’s a place called
Cracow in that region. What’s the matter of a pair
of mountain ranges between you and me, Bill?
You’re strong on geography, but you fail to follow
the campaign.”</p>

<p>“The Rhine, I say!”</p>

<p>“It’s the Rhine first, but Berlin is what you want
to keep your mind on.”</p>

<p>Then I asked if they had ever had any doubt that
they would reach the Rhine.</p>

<p>“How could we, sir?”</p>

<p>“And how about the Germans. Do you hate
them?”</p>

<p>“Hate!” exclaimed the big man. “What good
would it do to hate them? No, we don’t hate. We
get our blood up when we’re fighting and when they
don’t play the game. But hate! Don’t you think
that’s kind of ridiculous, sir?”</p>

<p>“How do they fight?”</p>

<p>“They take a bit of beating, do the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boches</i>!”</p>

<p>“So you call them <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boches</i>!”</p>

<p>“Yes. They don’t like that. But sometimes we
call them Allemands, which is Germans in French.
Oh, we’re getting quite French scholars!”</p>

<p>“They’re good soldiers. Not many tricks they’re
not up to. But in my opinion they’re overdoing the
hate. You can’t keep up to your work on hate, sir.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
I should think it would be weakening to the mind,
too.”</p>

<p>“Still, you would like the war over? You’d like
to go home?”</p>

<p>They certainly would. Back to the barracks, out
of the trenches. They certainly would.</p>

<p>“And call it a draw?”</p>

<p>“Call it a draw, now! Call it a draw, after all
we’ve been through&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Spring is coming. The ground will dry up and
it will be warm.”</p>

<p>“And the going will be good to Berlin, as it was
back from Paris in August, we tell the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boches</i>.”</p>

<p>“Good for the Russians going over the Carpathians,
or the Pyrenees, or whatever those mountains
are, too. I read they’re all covered with snow in
winter.”</p>

<p>It was good, regular soldier talk, very “homey”
to me. As you will observe, I have not elided the
h’s. Indeed, Tommy has a way of prefixing his h’s
to the right vowels more frequently than a generation
ago. The “Soldiers Three” type has passed.
Popular education will have its way and induce better
habits. Believing in the old remedy for exhaustion
and exposure to cold, the army served out a tot of
rum every day to the men. But many of them are
teetotalers, these hardy regulars, and not even Mulvaney
will think them effeminate when they have seen
fighting which makes anything Mulvaney ever saw
child’s play. So they asked for candy and chocolate,
instead of rum.</p>

<p>Some people have said that Tommy has no patriotism.
He fights because he is paid and it is his business.
That is an insinuation. Tommy doesn’t care<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
for the “hero stuff,” or for waving flags and speech-making.
Possibly he knows how few Germans that
sort of thing kills. His weapons are bullets. To
put it cogently, he is fighting because he doesn’t want
any Kaiser in his.</p>

<p>Is not that what all the speeches in Parliament are
about and all the editorials and the recruiting campaign?
Is not that what England and France are
fighting for? It seems to me that Tommy’s is a very
practical patriotism, free from cant; and the way that
he refuses to hate or to get excited, but sticks to it,
must be very irritating to the Germans.</p>

<p>“Would you like a <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boche</i> helmet for a souvenir,
sir?” asked a soldier, who appeared on the outer edge
of the group. He was the small, active type, a British
soldier with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élan</i> of the Frenchman. “There are
lots of them out there among the German dead”&mdash;the
unburied German dead, who fell like grass before
the mower in a desperate and futile counter-attack to
recover Neuve Chapelle. “I’ll have one for you on
your way back.”</p>

<p>There was no stopping him; he had gone.</p>

<p>“Matty’s a devil!” said the big man. “He’ll
get it, all right. He’s equal to reaching over the
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boches</i>’ parapet and picking one off a <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boche’s</i> head!”</p>

<p>As we proceeded on our way, officers came out of
the little houses to meet Captain P&mdash;&mdash; and the
stranger civilian. They had to come out, as there was
no room to take us inside; and sometimes they talked
shop together after I had answered the usual question,
“Is America against us?” There seemed to be an
idea that we were, possibly because of the prodigious
advertising tactics of a minority. But any feeling that
we might be did not interfere with their simple courtesy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
or lead them to express any bitterness or break
into argument.</p>

<p>“How are things going on over your side?”</p>

<p>“Nicely.”</p>

<p>“Any shelling?”</p>

<p>“A little this morning. No harm done.”</p>

<p>“We cleaned out one bad sniper to-day.”</p>

<p>“Ought to have some sandbags up to-night.”</p>

<p>“It’s a bad place there. They’ve got a machine
gun trained which has quite a sweep. I asked if the
artillery shouldn’t put in a word, but the general didn’t
think it worth while.”</p>

<p>“You must run across that break. Three or four
shots at you every time. We’re gradually getting
shipshape, though.”</p>

<p>Just then a couple of bullets went singing overhead.
The group paid no attention to them. If you paid attention
to bullets over the parapet you would have
no time for anything else. But these bullets have a
way of picking off tall officers, who are standing up
among their houses. In the course of their talk they
happened to mention such an instance, though not
with reference to the two bullets I have mentioned.</p>

<p>“Poor S&mdash;&mdash; did not last long. He had been out
only three weeks.”</p>

<p>“How is J&mdash;&mdash;? Hit badly?”</p>

<p>“Through the shoulder; not seriously.”</p>

<p>“H&mdash;&mdash; is back. Recovered very quickly.”</p>

<p>Normal trench talk, this! A crack which signifies
that the bullet has hit&mdash;another man down. One
grows accustomed to it, and one of this group of officers
might be gone to-morrow.</p>

<p>“I have one, sir,” said Matty, exhibiting a helmet
when we returned past his station. “Bullet went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
right through the head and came out the peak!”</p>

<p>It was time that Captain P&mdash;&mdash; was back to his own
command. As we came to his company’s line word
was just being passed from sentry to sentry:</p>

<p>“Not firing. Patrols going out.”</p>

<p>It was midnight now.</p>

<p>“We’ll go in the other direction,” said Captain
P&mdash;&mdash;, when he had learned that there was no news.</p>

<p>This brought us to an Irish regiment. The Irish
naturally had something to say.</p></div>

<span class="subhead">WITH THE IRISH</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The Irish have something to say!&mdash;The Irish in America&mdash;The misguided
Germans&mdash;The American’s visit an event&mdash;Veterans of
Mons&mdash;Eggs in the trenches!&mdash;Irish hospitality&mdash;A dum-dum
souvenir&mdash;A memorable drink&mdash;Sixty yards from the Germans&mdash;The

heaven of soap and hot water&mdash;In the captain’s “house”&mdash;Soldier
shop talk&mdash;Trench appetite&mdash;A village literally
flailed&mdash;Pity the refugees.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here, not the Irish Sea lay between the broad <em>a</em> and
the brogue, but the space between two sentries or between
two rifles with bayonets fixed, lying against the
wall of the breastworks ready for their owners’ hands
when called to arms in case of an alarm. One stepped
from England into Ireland; and my prediction that
the Irish would have something to say was correct.
They had; for that matter, there are always individual
Irishmen in the English regiments, lest English
phlegm should let conversation run short.</p>

<p>The first man who made his presence felt was a
good six feet in height, with a heavy moustache, and
the ear-pieces of his cap tied under his chin though
the night was not cold. He placed himself fairly in
front of me in the narrow path back of the breastworks
and he looked a cowled and sinister figure in
the faint glow from a brazier. I certainly did not
want any physical argument with a man of his build.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he demanded, as stiffly as if I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
had broken in at the veranda window with a jimmy.</p>

<p>For the nearer you get to the front, the more you
feel that you are in the way. You are a stray extra
piece of baggage; a dead human weight. Every one
is doing something definite as a part of the machine
except yourself; and in your civilian clothes you feel
the self-conscious conspicuousness of appearing on a
dancing-floor in a dressing-gown.</p>

<p>Captain P&mdash;&mdash; was a little way back in another passage.
I was alone and in a rough tweed suit&mdash;a
strange figure in that world of khaki and rifles.</p>

<p>“A German spy! That’s why I am dressed this
way, so as not to excite suspicion,” I was going to say,
when a call from Captain P&mdash;&mdash; identified me, and
the sentry’s attitude changed as suddenly as if
the inspector of police had come along and told
a patrolman that I might pass through the fire-lines.</p>

<p>“So it’s you, is it, right from America?” he said.
“I’ve a sister living at Nashua, New Hampshire,
U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;A., with three brothers in the United States
army.”</p>

<p>Whether he had or not you can judge as well as
I by the twinkle in his eye. He might have had five,
and again he might not have one. I was a tenderfoot
seeing the trenches.</p>

<p>“It’s mesilf that’s going to America when me sarvice
in the army is up in one year and six months,”
he continued. “That’s some time yet. I’m going
if I’m not killed by the Germans. It’s a way that
they have, or we wouldn’t be killing them.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do in America? Enlist
in the army?”</p>

<p>“No. I’m looking for a better job. I’m thinking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
I’ll be one of your millionaires. Shure, but that
would be to me taste.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of the Germans?”</p>

<p>“It’s little thinking we’re doing and more shooting.
Now do ye know our opinion of them?”</p>

<p>“Some of the Irish in America are pro-German.”</p>

<p>“Now will ye listen to that! Their words come
out of their mouths without acquainting their heads
and hearts with what they are saying. Did you ever
find nine Irishmen on the right side without one doing
the talking for the divil for the joy of argument?
It’s the Irish that would be at home in the German
army doing the goose-step and taking orders from the
Kaiser, is it not, now?”</p>

<p>“And what about the Germans&mdash;are they winning?”</p>

<p>“They started out strong, singing and goose-stepping
high, for the Kaiser had told them that if they
died for him they could burgle the world, and they
thought it a grand idea. Shure, we accommodated
them. There’s plenty of them dead, and some of
them are wondering if, when they’re all dead, the
Kaiser will have any more of the world than when he
started, which makes them sorry for him and they
give him another ‘Hoch’! ’Tis the nature of them,
because they’ve never been told different.”</p>

<p>Not one Irishman was speaking really, but a dozen.
They came out of their little houses and dugouts to
gather around the brazier; and for every remark I
made I received a fusillade in reply. It was an event,
an American appearing in that trench in the small
hours of the morning.</p>

<p>“I’ve a brother in Oklahoma!” said one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
“Is he a millionaire yet?” I asked.</p>

<p>“If he is he’s keeping it a secret!”</p>

<p>Some of them had been at Mons; a few of them had
gone through the whole campaign without a scratch;
more had been wounded and returned to the front. I
like to ask that question, “Were you at Mons?” and
get the answer, “Yes, sir, I was; I was through it
all!” without boasting&mdash;a Mons veteran need not
boast&mdash;but in the spirit of pride. To have been at
Mons, where that hard-bought retreat of one against
five began, will ever be enough glory for English,
Scotch, Irish, or Welsh. It is like saying, “I was in
Pickett’s charge!”</p>

<p>A trench-toughened, battle-toughened old sergeant
was sitting in the doorway of his dugout, frying a strip
of bacon over one rim of the brazier and making tea
over the other. The bacon sizzled with an appetising
aroma and a bullet sizzled harmlessly overhead. Behind
that wall of sandbags all were perfectly safe, unless
a shell came. But who worries about shells? It
is like worrying about being struck by lightning when
clouds gather in a summer sky.</p>

<p>“It looks like good bacon,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“It is that!” said the sergeant. “And the hungrier
ye are the better. It’s your nose that’s telling
ye so this minute. I can see that ye’re hungry yoursilf!”</p>

<p>“Then you’re pretty well fed?”</p>

<p>“Well fed, is it? It’s stuffed we are, like the
geese that grow the paté what-do-you-call-it? Eating
is our pastime. We eat when we’ve nothing else to
do and when we’ve got to do something. We get eggs
up here&mdash;a fine man is Lord Kitchener&mdash;yes, sir,
eggs up here in the trenches!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
When they seemed to think that I was sceptical, he
produced some eggs in evidence.</p>

<p>“And if ye’ll not have the bacon, ye’ll have a drop
of tea. Mind, now, while your tongue is trying to be
polite, your stomach is calling your tongue a liar!”</p>

<p>Irish hospitality responded to the impulse of a
warm Irish heart. Wouldn’t I have a souvenir?
Out came German bullets and buckles and officers’
whistles and helmets and fragments of shells and
German diaries.</p>

<p>“It’s easy to get them out there where the Germans
fell that thick!” I was told. “And will ye look at
this and take it home to give your pro-German Irish
in America, to show what their friends are shooting
at the Irish? I found them mesilf on a dead German.”</p>

<p>He passed me a clip of German bullets with the
blunt ends instead of the pointed ends out. The
change is readily made, for the German bullet is easily
pulled out of the cartridge case and the pointed end
thrust against the powder. Thus fired, it goes accurately
four or five hundred yards, which is more than
the average distance between German and British
trenches. When it strikes flesh the effect is that of a
dum-dum and worse; for the jacket splits into slivers,
which spread through the pulpy mass caused by the
explosion. A leg or an arm thus hit must almost invariably
be amputated. I am not suggesting that this
is a regular practice with German soldiers, but it
shows what wickedness is in the power of the sinister
one.</p>

<p>“But ye’ll take the tea,” said the sergeant, “with a
little rum hot in it. ’Twill take the chill out of your
bones.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
“What if I haven’t a chill in my bones?”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s there without speaking to ye and it
will be speaking before an hour longer&mdash;or afther
ye’re home between the sheets with the rheumatiz,
and ye’ll be saying, ‘Why didn’t I take that glass?’
which I’m holding out to ye this minute, steaming its
invitation to be drunk.”</p>

<p>Held out by a man who had been at Mons and
“through it all”! It was a memorable drink.
Champagne poured out by a butler at your elbow is
insipid beside it. Snatches of brogue followed me
from the brazier’s glow when I insisted that I must
be going.</p>

<p>Now our breastworks took a turn and we were approaching
closer to the German breastworks. Both
lines remained where they had “dug in” after the
counter-attacks which had followed the battle had been
checked. Ground is too precious in this siege warfare
to yield a foot. Soldiers become misers of soil.
Where the flood is checked there you build your dam
against another flood.</p>

<p>“We are within about sixty yards of the Germans,”
said Captain P&mdash;&mdash;, at length, after we had gone in
and out of the traverses and left the braziers well
behind.</p>

<p>Between the spotty, whitish wall of German sandbags,
quite distinct in the moonlight, and our parapet
were two mounds of sandbags about twenty feet apart.
Snug behind one was a German and behind the other
an Irishman, both listening. They were within easy
bombing range, but the homicidal advantage of position
of either resulted in a truce. Sixty yards!
Pace it off. It is not far. In other places the enemies
have been as close as five yards&mdash;only a wall of earth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
between them. Where a bombing operation ends in
an attack, a German is naturally on one side of a
traverse and a Briton on the other.</p>

<p>The Germans were as busy as beavers dam building.
They had a lot of work to do before they had their
new defences right. We heard them driving stakes
and spading; we heard their voices with snatches of
sentences intelligible and occasionally the energetic,
shouted, guttural commands of their officers. All
through that night I never heard a British officer speak
above a conversational tone. The orders were definite
enough, but given with a certain companionable
kindliness. I have spoken of the genuine affection
which his men showed for Captain P&mdash;&mdash;, and I was
beginning to appreciate that it was not a particular
instance.</p>

<p>“What if you should shout at Tommy in the German
fashion?” I asked.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t have it; he’d get rebellious,” was the
reply. “No, you mustn’t yell at Tommy. He’s a
little temperamental about some things and he will not
be treated as if he were just a human machine.”</p>

<p>Yet no one will question the discipline of the British
soldier. Discipline means that the officer knows
his men, and British discipline, which bears a retreat
like that from Mons, requires that the man likes to
follow his officers, believes in his officers, loves his
officers. Each army and each people to its own ways.</p>

<p>Sixty yards! And the dead between the trenches
and death lurking ready at a trigger’s pull should life
show itself! When daylight comes the British sing
out their “Good morning, Germans!” and the Germans
answer, “Good morning, British!” without
adding, “We hope to kill some of you to-day!”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>
Ragging banter and jest and worse than jest and grim
defiance are exchanged between the trenches when
they are within such easy hearing distance of each
other; but always from a safe position behind the parapet
which the adversaries squint across through their
periscopes. The thing was ridiculous.</p>

<p>At the gibe business the German is, perhaps, better
than the Briton. Early in the evening a regiment on
our right broke into a busy fusillade at some fancied
movement of the enemy. In trench talk, that is getting
“jumpy.” The Germans in front roared out
their contempt in a chorus of guying laughter.
Toward morning, these same Germans also became
“jumpy” and began tearing the air with bullets, firing
against nothing but the blackness of night. Tommy
Atkins only made some characteristic comments; for
he is a quiet fellow, except when he is played on the
music hall stage. Possibly he feels the inconsistency
of laughter when you are killing human beings; for,
as his officers say, he is temperamental and never goes
to the trouble of analysing his emotions. A very real
person and a good deal of a philosopher is Mr. Atkins,
Britain’s professional fighting man, who was the
only kind of fighting man she had ready for the war.</p>

<p>Any small boy who had never had enough fireworks
in his life might be given a job in the German trenches,
with the privilege of firing flares till he fell asleep
from exhaustion. All night they were going, with the
regularity of clockwork. The only ones sent up from
our side that night were shot in order that I might get
a better view of the German dead.</p>

<p>You know how water lies in the low places on the
ground after a heavy rain. Well, the patches of dead
were like that, and dark in the spots where they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
very thick&mdash;dark as with the darkness of deeper
water. There were also irregular tongues of dead
and scattered dead, with arms outstretched or under
them as they fell, and faces white even in the reddish
glare of the rockets and turned toward you in the
charge that failed under the withering blasts of machine
guns, ripping out two or three hundred shots a
minute, and well-aimed rifle bullets, each bullet getting
its man. Threatening that charge would have seemed
to a recruit, but measured and calculated in certainty
of failure in the minds of veteran defenders, who knew
that the wheat could not stand before their mowers.
Man’s flesh is soft and a bullet is hard and travels fast.</p>

<p>One bit of satire which Tommy sent across the field
covered with its burden of slaughter to the Germans
who are given to song, ought to have gone home. It
was: “Why don’t you stop singing and bury your
dead?” But the Germans, having given no armistice
in other times when British dead lay before the
trenches, asked for none here. The dead were nearer
to the British than to the Germans. The discomfort
would be in British and not German nostrils. And
the dead cannot fight; they can help no more to win
victory for the Fatherland. And the time is A.&nbsp;D.,
1915. Two or three thousand German dead altogether,
perhaps&mdash;not many out of the Kaiser’s millions.
Yet they seemed a great many to one who saw
them lying there.</p>

<p>We stopped to read by the light of a brazier some
German soldiers’ diaries that the Irishmen had.
They were cheap little books, bought for a few cents,
each one telling the dead man’s story and revealing the
monotony of a soldier’s existence in Europe to-day.
These pawns of war had been marched here and there,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
they never knew why. The last notes were when
orders came entraining them. They did not know
that they were to be sent out of those woods yonder to
recover Neuve Chapelle&mdash;out of those woods in the
test of all their drill and waiting.</p>

<p>A Bavarian officer&mdash;for these were Bavarians&mdash;actually
rode in that charge. He must have worked
himself up to a strangely exalted optimism and contempt
of British fire. Or was it that he, too, did not
know what he was going against? that only the German
general knew? Neither he nor his horse lasted
long; not more than a dozen seconds. The thing was
so splendidly foolhardy that in some little war it
might have become the saga of a regiment, the subject
of ballads and paintings. In this war it was an incident
heralded for a day in one command and forgotten
the next.</p>

<p>“Good night!” called the Irish.</p>

<p>“Good night and good luck!”</p>

<p>“Tell them in America that the Irish are still fighting!”</p>

<p>“Good luck, and may your travelling be aisy; but
if ye trip, may ye fall into a gold mine!”</p>

<p>We were back with the British regulars; and here,
also, many of the men remained up around the
braziers. The hours of duty of the few on watch do
not take many of the twenty-four hours. One may
sleep when he chooses in the little houses behind the
breastworks. Night melts into day and day into
night in the monotony of mud and sniping rifle-fire.
By-and-by it is your turn to go into reserve; your
turn to get out of your clothes&mdash;for there are no
pajamas for officers or men in these “crawls,” as they
are sometimes called. Boots off is the only undressing;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
boots off and puttees unloosed, which saves the
feet. Yes, by-and-by the march back to the rear,
where there are tubs filled with hot water and an outfit
of clean clothes awaiting you, and nothing to do but
rest and sleep.</p>

<p>“How soon after we leave the trenches may we
cheer?” officers have been asked in the dead of winter,
when water stood deep over the porous mud and
morning found a scale of ice around the legs.</p>

<p>You, nicely testing the temperature of your morning
tub; you, satisfied only with faucets of hot and cold
water and a mat to stand on&mdash;you know nothing
about the joy of bathing. Your bath is a mere part
of the daily routine of existence. Try the trenches
and get itchy with vermin; then you will know that
heaven consists of soap and hot water.</p>

<p>No bad odour assails your nostrils wherever you
may go in the British lines. Its cleanliness, if nothing
else, would make British army comradeship enjoyable.
My wonder never ceases how Tommy keeps
himself so neat; how he manages to shave every day
and get a part, at least, of the mud off his uniform.
It makes him feel more as if he were “at home” in
barracks.</p>

<p>From the breastworks, Captain P&mdash;&mdash; and I went
for a stroll in the village, or the site of the village,
silent except for the occasional singing of a bullet.
When we returned he lighted the candle on a stick
stuck into the wall of his little earth-roofed house and
suggested a nap. It was three o’clock in the morning.
Now I could see that my rubber boots had grown so
heavy because I was carrying so much of the soil of
Northern France. It looked as if I had gout in both
feet&mdash;the over-bandaged, stage type of gout&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>which
were encased in large mud poultices. I tried to
stamp off the incubus, but it would not go. I tried
scraping one foot on the other, and what I scraped off
seemed to reattach itself as fast as I could remove it.</p>

<p>“Don’t try!” said the captain. “Lie down and
pull your boots off in the doorway. Perhaps you will
get some sleep before daybreak.”</p>

<p>Sleep! Does a débutante go to sleep at her first
ball? Sleep in such good company, the company of
this captain, who was smiling all the while with his
eyes; smiling at his mud house, at the hardships in the
trenches, and, I hope, at having a guest, who had been
with armies before!</p>

<p>It was the first time that I had been in the trenches
all night; the first time, indeed, when I had not been
taken into them by an escort in a kind of promenade.
On this visit I was in the family. If it is the right
kind of a family that is the way to get a good impression.
There would be plenty of time to sleep when I
returned to London.</p>

<p>So Captain P&mdash;&mdash; and I lay there talking. One
felt the dampness of the earth under his body and the
walls exuded moisture. The average cellar was dry
by comparison. “You will get your death of cold!”
any mother would cry in alarm if her boy were found
even sitting on such cold, wet ground. For it was a
clammy night of early spring. Yet, peculiarly enough,
few men get colds from this exposure. One gets
colds from draughts in overheated rooms much
oftener. Luckily, it was not raining; it had been raining
most of the winter in the flat country of Northern
France and Flanders.</p>

<p>“It is very horrible, this kind of warfare,” said the
captain. He was thinking of the method of it, rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
than of the discomforts. “All war is very horrible,
of course.” Regular soldiers rarely take any other
view. They know war.</p>

<p>“With your wounded arm you might be back in
England on leave,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“Oh, that arm is all right!” he replied. “This is
what I am paid for”&mdash;which I had heard regulars
say before. “And it is for England!” he added, in
his quiet way. “Sometimes I think we should fight
better if we officers could hate the Germans,” he went
on. “The German idea is that you must hate if you
are going to fight well. But we can’t hate.”</p>

<p>Sound views he had about the war; sounder than I
have heard from the lips of cabinet ministers. For
these regular officers are specialists in war.</p>

<p>“Do you think that we shall starve the Germans
out?”</p>

<p>“No. We must win by fighting,” he replied.
This was in March, 1915. “You know,” he went on,
taking another tack, “when one gets back to England
out of this muck he wants good linen and everything
very nice.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve found the same after roughing it,” I
agreed. “One is most particular that he has every
comfort to which civilisation entitles him.”</p>

<p>We chatted on. Much of our talk was soldier shop
talk, which you will not care to hear. Twice we were
interrupted by an outburst of firing, and the captain
hurried out to ascertain the reason. Some false alarm
had started the rifles speaking from both sides. A
fusillade for two or three minutes and the firing died
down to silence.</p>

<p>Dawn broke and it was time for me to go; and
with daylight, when danger of a night surprise was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
over, the captain would have his sleep. I was leaving
him to his mud house and his bed on the wet ground
without a blanket. It was more important to have
sandbags up for the breastworks than to have blankets;
and as the men had not yet received theirs, he
had none himself.</p>

<p>“It’s not fair to the men,” he said. “I don’t want
anything they don’t have.”</p>

<p>No better food and no better house and no warmer
garments! He spoke not in any sense of stated duty,
but in the affection of the comradeship of war; the
affection born of that imperturbable courage of his
soldiers, who had stood a stone wall of cool resolution
against German charges when it seemed as if they
must go. The glamour of war may have departed,
but not the brotherhood of hardship and dangers
shared.</p>

<p>What had been a routine night to him had been a
great night to me; one of the most memorable of
my life.</p>

<p>“I was glad you could come,” he said, as I made
my adieu, quite as if he were saying adieu to a guest
at home in England.</p>

<p>Some of the soldiers called their cheery good-byes;
and with a lieutenant to guide me, I set out while the
light was still dusky, leaving the comforting parapet
to the rear to go into the open, four hundred yards
from the Germans. A German, though he could not
have seen us distinctly, must have noted something
moving. Two of his bullets came rather close before
we passed out of his vision among some trees.</p>

<p>In a few minutes I was again entering the peasant’s
cottage that was battalion headquarters; this time by
daylight. Its walls were chipped by bullets that had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
come over the breastworks. The major was just getting
up from his blankets in the cellar. By this time
I had a real trench appetite. Not until after breakfast
did it occur to me, with some surprise, that I had
not washed my face.</p>

<p>“The food was just as good, wasn’t it?” remarked
the major. “We get quite used to such breaches of
convention. Besides, you had been up all night, so
your breakfast might be called your after-the-theatre
supper.”</p>

<p>With him I went to see what the ruins of Neuve
Chapelle looked like by daylight. The destruction
was not all the result of one bombardment, for the
British had been shelling Neuve Chapelle off and on
all winter. Of course, there is the old earthquake
comparison. All writers have used it. But it is
quite too feeble for Neuve Chapelle. An earthquake
merely shakes down houses. The shells had done a
good deal more than that. They had crushed the
remains of the houses as under the pestle head in a
mortar; blown walls into dust; taken bricks from the
east side of the house over to the west and thrown
them back with another explosion.</p>

<p>Neuve Chapelle had been literally flailed with the
high explosive projectiles of the new British artillery,
which the British had to make after the war began to
compete with what the Germans already had; for
poor, lone, wronged, bullied Germany quite unprepared&mdash;Austria
with her fifty millions does not
count&mdash;was fighting on the defensive against wicked,
aggressive enemies who were fully prepared. This
explains why she invaded France and took possession
of towns like Neuve Chapelle to defend her poor, unready
people from the French, who had been plotting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
and planning “the day” when they would conquer the
Germans.</p>

<p>Bits of German equipment were mixed with ruins
of clocks and family pictures and household utensils.
I noticed a bicycle which had been cut in two, its parts
separated by twenty feet; one wheel was twisted into a
spool of wire, the other simply mashed.</p>

<p>Where was the man who had kept the shop with a
few letters of his name still visible on a splintered
bit of board? Where the children who had played in
the littered square in front of the church, with its
steeples and walls piles of stone that had crushed the
worshippers’ benches? Refugees somewhere back of
the British lines, working on the roads if strong
enough, helping France any way they could, not murmuring,
even smiling, and praying for victory, which
would let them return to their homes and daily duties.
To their homes!</p></div>

<span class="subhead">WITH THE GUNS</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>A war of explosions&mdash;And machines&mdash;Battle-panorama style&mdash;Value
of surprise&mdash;Ever hungry guns&mdash;Accurate or blind and
groping guns&mdash;Demon guns&mdash;Balloon observations&mdash;Finding

<p>It is a war of explosions, from bombs thrown by hand
within ten yards of the enemy to shells thrown as far
as twenty miles and mines laid under the enemy’s
trenches; a war of guns, from seventeen-inch down to
three-inch and machine guns; a war of machinery, with
man still the pre-eminent machine.</p>

<p>Guns mark the limit of the danger zone. Their
screaming shells laugh at the sentries at the entrances
to towns and at cross-roads who demand passes of all
other travellers. Any one who tried to keep out of
range of the guns would never get anywhere near the
front. It is all a matter of chance, with long odds or
short odds, according to the neighbourhood you are
in. If shells come, they come without warning and
without ceremony. Nobody is afraid of shells and
everybody is&mdash;at least, I am.</p>

<p>“Gawd! W’at a ’ole!” remarks Mr. Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Atkins casually, at sight of an excavation in the earth
made by a thousand-pound projectile.</p>

<p>It is only eighteen years ago that, at the battle of
Domoko in the Greco-Turkish war, I saw half a dozen
Turkish batteries swing out on the plain of Thessaly,
limber up in the open and discharge salvos with black
powder, in the good, old, battle-panorama style. One
battery of modern field guns unseen would wipe out
the lot in five minutes. Only ten years ago, at the
battle of Liao-yang, as I watched a cloud of shrapnel
smoke sending down steel showers over the little hill
of Manjanyama, which sent up showers of earth from
shells burst by impact on the ground, a Japanese military
attaché remarked:</p>

<p>“There you have a prophecy of what a European
war will be like!”</p>

<p>He was right. He knew his business as a military
attaché. The voices of the guns along the front seem
never silent. In some direction they are always firing.
When one night the reports from a certain quarter
seemed rather heavy, I asked the reason the next day.</p>

<p>“No, not very heavy. No attack,” a division staff
officer explained. “The <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boches</i> had been building a
redoubt and we turned on some h.&nbsp;e.&nbsp;s.”&mdash;meaning
high explosive shells.</p>

<p>Night after night, under cover of darkness, the Germans
had been labouring on that redoubt, thinking
that they were unobserved. They had kept extremely
quiet, too, slipping their spades into the earth softly
and hammering a nail ever so lightly; and, of course,
the redoubt was placed behind a screen of foliage which
hid it from the view of the British trenches. Such is
the hide-and-seek character of modern war. What
the German builders did not know was that a British<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
aeroplane had been watching them day by day and
that the spot was nicely registered on a British gunner’s
map. On this map it was a certain numbered
point. Press a button, as it were, and you ring the
bell with a shell at that point. The gunners waited
till the house of cards was up before knocking it to
pieces.</p>

<p>Surprise is the thing with the guns. A town may
go for weeks without getting a single shell. Then
it may get a score in ten minutes; or it may be shelled
regularly every day for weeks. “They are shelling
X again,” or, “They have been leaving Z alone for
a long time,” is a part of the gossip up and down the
line. Towns are proud of having escaped altogether
and proud of the number and size of the shells received.</p>

<p>“Did you get any?” I asked the division staff
officer, who had told me about the session the six-inch
howitzers had enjoyed. A common question that, at
the front, “Did you get any?” (meaning Germans).
A practical question, too. It has nothing to do with
the form of play or any bit of sensational fielding;
only with the score, with results, with casualties.</p>

<p>“Yes, quite a number,” said the officer. “Our
observer saw them lying about.”</p>

<p>The guns are watching for targets at all hours&mdash;the
ever hungry, ever ready, murderous, cunning,
quick, scientifically calculating, marvellously accurate,
and also the guessing, wondering, blind, groping, helpless,
guns, which toss their steel messengers over
streams, woodlands, and towns, searching for their
unseen prey in a wide landscape.</p>

<p>Accurate and murderous they seem when you drop
low behind a trench wall or huddle in a dugout as you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
hear an approaching scream, and the earth trembles,
the air is wracked by a concussion, and the cry of a
man a few yards away tells of a hit. Very accurate
when still others, sent from muzzles six or seven thousand
yards away, fall in that same line of trench!
Very accurate when, before an infantry attack, with
bursts of shrapnel bullets they cut to bits the barbed-wire
entanglements in front of a trench! The power
of chaos that they seem to possess when the fighting-trench
and the dugouts and all the human warrens
which protect the defenders are beaten as flour is
kneaded!</p>

<p>Blind and groping they seem when a dozen shells
fall harmlessly in a field; when they send their missiles
toward objects which may not be worth shooting at;
when no one sees where the shells hit and the amount
of damage they have done is guesswork; and helpless
without the infantry to protect them, the aeroplanes
and the observers to see for them.</p>

<p>One thinks of them as demons with subtle intelligence
and long reach, their gigantic fists striking here
and there at will, without a visible arm behind the
blow. An army guards against the blows of an enemy’s
demons with every kind of cover, every kind of
deception, with all resources of scientific ingenuity and
invention; and an army guards its own demons in
their lairs as preciously as if they were made of some
delicate substance which would go up in smoke at a
glance from the enemy’s eye, instead of having barrels
of the strongest steel that can be forged.</p>

<p>Your personal feeling for the demons on your side
is in ratio to the amount of hell sent by the enemy’s
which you have tasted. After you have been scared
stiff, while pretending that you were not, by sharing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
with Mr. Atkins an accurate bombardment of a trench
and are convinced that the next shell is bound to get
you, you fall into the attitude of the army. You want
to pat the demon on the back and say, “Nice old
demon!” and watch him toss a shell three or four
miles into the German lines from the end of his fiery
tongue. Indeed, nothing so quickly develops interest
in the British guns as having the German gunners take
too much personal interest in you.</p>

<p>You must have some one to show you the way or
you would not find any guns. A man with a dog
trained to hunt guns might spend a week on the gun-position
area covering ten miles of the front and not
locate half the guns. He might miss “Grandmother”
and “Sister” and “Betsy” and “Mike”
and even “Mister Archibald,” who is the only one
who does not altogether try to avoid publicity.</p>

<p>When an attack or an artillery bombardment is on
and you go to as high ground as possible for a bird’s-eye
view of battle, all you see is the explosion of the
shells; never anything of the guns which are firing.
In the distance over the German lines and in the foreground
over the British lines is a balloon, shaped like
a caterpillar with folded wings&mdash;a chrysalis of a
caterpillar. Tugging at its moorings, it turns this
way and that with the breeze. The speck directly
beneath it through the glasses becomes an ordinary
balloon basket and other specks attached to a guy rope
play the part of the tail of a kite, helping to steady
the type of balloon which has taken the place of the
old spherical type for observation.</p>

<p>Any one who has been up in a captive spherical balloon
knows how difficult it is to keep his glasses
focussed on any object, because of the jerking and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
pitching and trembling due to the envelope’s response
to air-movements. The new type partly overcomes
this drawback. To shrapnel their thin envelope is
as vulnerable as a paper drum-head to a knife; but I
have seen them remain up defiantly when shells were
bursting within three or four hundred yards, which
their commanders seemed to understand was the limit
of the German battery’s reach. Again, I have seen a
shrapnel burst alongside within range; and five minutes
later the balloon was down and out of sight. No balloon
observer hopes to see the enemy’s guns. He is
watching for shell-bursts, in order to inform the guns
of his side whether or not they are on the target.</p>

<p>Riding along the roads at the front, one may know
that there is a battery a stone’s throw away only when
a blast from a hidden gun-muzzle warns him of its
presence. It was wonderful to me that the artillery
general who took me gun-seeing knew where his own
guns were, let alone the enemy’s. I imagine that he
could return to a field and locate a four-leafed clover
that he had seen on a previous stroll. His dogs of
war had become foxes of war, burrowing in places
which wise, old father foxes knew were safest from
detection. Hereafter, I shall not be surprised to see
a muzzle poking its head out of an oven, or from under
grandfather’s chair or a farm wagon, or up a tree,
or in a garret. Think of the last place in the world
for emplacing a gun and one may be there; think of
the most likely place and one may be there.</p>

<p>You might be walking across the fields and minded
to go through a hedge and bump into a black ring of
steel with a gun’s crew grinning behind it. They
would grin because you had given proof of how well
their gun was concealed. But they wouldn’t grin as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
much as they would if they saw the enemy plunking
shells into another hedge two hundred yards distant,
where the German aeroplane observer thought he had
seen a battery and had not.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you a big one, first!” said the general.</p>

<p>We left the car at a cottage and walked along a
lane. I looked all about the premises and could see
only some artillerymen. An officer led me up to a
gun-breech; at least, I know a gun-breech when it is
one foot from my nose and a soldier has removed its
covering. But I shall not tell how that gun was concealed;
the method was so audacious that it was entirely
successful. The Germans would like to know
and we don’t want them to know. A pencil-point on
their map for identification, and they would send a
whirlwind of shells at that gun.</p>

<p>And then?</p>

<p>Would the gun try to fire back? No. Its gunners
probably would not know the location of any of
the German batteries which had concentrated on their
treasure. They would desert the gun. If they did
not, they ought to be court-martialed for needlessly
risking the precious lives of trained men. They
would make for the “funk pits,” just as the gunners
of any other power would.</p>

<p>The chances are that the gun itself would not be
hit bodily by a shell. Fragments might strike it without
causing more than an abrasion; for big guns have
pretty thick cuticle. When the storm was over, the
gunners would move the gun to another hiding-place;
which would mean a good deal of work on account of
its size.</p>

<p>It is the inability of gun to see gun, and even when
seen to knock out gun, which has put an end to the so-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>called
artillery duel of pitched-battle days, when cannon
walloped cannon to keep cannon from walloping
the infantry. Now when there is an action, though
guns still go after guns if they know where they are,
most of the firing is done against trenches and to support
trenches and infantry works, or with a view to
demoralising the infantry. Concentration of artillery
fire will demolish an enemy’s trench and let your infantry
take possession of the wreckage remaining; but
then the enemy’s artillery concentrates on your infantry
and frequently makes their new habitation untenable.</p>

<p>Noiselessly except for a little click, with chickens
clucking in a field near by, the big breech-block which
held the shell fast, sending all the power of the explosion
out of the muzzle, was swung back and one
looked through the shining tube of steel, with its rifling
which caught the driving band and gave the shell its
rotation and accuracy in its long journey, which would
close when, descending at the end of its parabola, its
nose struck brick or earth or pavement and it exploded.</p>

<p>Wheels that lift and depress and swing the muzzle,
and gadgets with figures on them, and other scales
which play between the map and the gadgets, and
atmospheric pressure and wind variation, all worked
out with the same precision under a French hedge as
on board a battleship where the gun-mounting is fast
to massive ribs of steel&mdash;it seemed a matter of bookkeeping
and trigonometry rather than war.</p>

<p>If a shell from this gun were to hit at the corner of
Wall Street and Broadway at the noon hour, it would
probably kill and wound a hundred men. If it went
into the dugout of a support trench it would get everybody<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
there; but if it went ten yards beyond the trench
into the open field it would probably get nobody.</p>

<p>“Cover!” some one exclaimed, while we were looking
at the gun; and everybody promptly got under the
branches of a tree or a shed. A German aeroplane
was cruising in our direction. If the aviator saw a
group of men standing about, he might draw conclusions
and pass the wireless word to send in some shells
at whatever number on the German gunners’ map was
ours.</p>

<p>These gunners loved their gun; loved it for the
power which it could put into a blow under their
trained hands; loved it for the care and the labour it
had meant for them. It is the way of gunners to love
their gun, or they would not be good gunners. Of all
the guns I saw that day, I think that two big howitzers
meant the most to their masters. These had just arrived.
They had been set up only two days. They
had not yet fired against the enemy. For many
months the gunners had drilled in England, and had
tried their “eight-inch hows” out on the target range,
and brought them across the Channel, and nursed
them along the French roads, and finally set them up
in their hidden lair. Now they waited for observers
to assist them in registration.</p>

<p>When the general approached there was a call to
turn out the guard; but he stopped that. At the front
there is an end of the ceremoniousness of the barracks.
Military formality disappears. Discipline, as well as
other things, is simpler and more real. The men
went on with their recess, playing football in a nearby
field.</p>

<p>The officers possibly were a trifle diffident and uncertain;
they had not yet the veterans’ manner. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
was clear that they had done everything required by
the text-book of theory&mdash;the latest, up-to-date text-book
of experience at the front as taught in England.
When they showed us how they had stored their stock
of shells to be safe from a shot by the enemy, one remarked
that the method was according to the latest
directions, though there was some difference among
military experts on the subject. When there is a difference,
what is the beginner to do? An old hand,
of course, does it his way until an order makes him do
otherwise.</p>

<p>The general had a suggestion about the application
of the method. He had little to say, the general, and
it all was in the spirit of comradeship and much to the
point. Few things escaped his observation. It seems
fairly true that one who knows any branch of human
endeavour well makes his work appear easy. Once a
gunner always a gunner is characteristic of all armies.
The general had spent his life with guns. He was a
specialist visiting his plant; one of the staff specialists
responsible to a corps commander for the work of the
guns on a certain section of map, for accuracy and
promptness of fire when it was needed in the commander’s
plans.</p>

<p>If the newcomers put their shells into the target on
their first trial they had qualified; and sometimes new-comers
shoot quite as well as veterans, which is a surprise
to both and the best kind of news for the general
who is in charge of an expanding plant. New
guns are just beginning to come; England is only beginning
to make war. It takes time to make a gun
and time to train men to fire it. The war will be won
by gunners and infantry that knew nothing of guns or
drill when the war began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
“Here are some who have been in France from the
first,” said the general, when we came to a battery of
field-guns; of the eighteen-pounders, the fellows you
see behind the galloping horses, the hell-for-leather
guns, the guns which bring the gleam of affection into
the eyes of men who think of pursuits and covering
retreats and the pitched-battle conditions, before
armies settled down in trenches and growled and
hissed at each other day after day and brought up
guns of calibres which we associate with battleships
and coast fortifications.</p>

<p>These are called “light stuff” and “whiz-bangs”
now, in army parlance. They throw an eighteen-pound
shell which carries three hundred bullets, and
so fast that one chases another through the air.
There has been so much talk about the need of heavy
guns that you might think eighteen-pounders were too
small for consideration. Were the German line broken,
these are the ones which could follow as rapidly
as the engineers could lay bridges for them to cross.</p>

<p>They are the boys who weave the “curtain of fire”
which you read about in the French official bulletins as
checking an infantry charge; which demolish the
barbed-wire entanglements to let an infantry charge
get into a trench. If a general wants a shower of bullets
over any part of the German line he has only to
call up the eighteen-pounders and it is sent as promptly
as the pressure of a button brings a pitcher of iced
water to a room in a first-class hotel. A veteran eighteen-pounder
crew in action is a poem in precision and
speed of movement. The gun itself seems to possess
intelligence.</p>

<p>There was the finesse of gunners’ craft, worthy of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
veterans, in the way that these eighteen-pounders were
concealed. The Germans had put some shells in the
neighbourhood, but without fooling the old hands.
They did not change the location of their battery, and
their judgment that the shots which came near were
chance shots fired at another object was justified.
Particularly I should like to mention their “funk pits,”
which kept them safe from the heaviest shells. For
the veterans knew how to take care of themselves;
they had an eye to the protection which comes of experience
with German high explosives. Their expert
knowledge of all the ins and outs of their business had
been fought into them for eleven months.</p>

<p>Another field battery, also, I have in mind, placed
in an orchard. Which orchard of all the thousands of
orchards along the British front the German Staff may
guess, if they choose. If German guns fired at all the
orchards, one by one, they might locate it&mdash;and then
again they might not. Besides, this is a peculiar sort
of orchard.</p>

<p>It is a characteristic of gunners to be neat and to
have an eye for the comeliness of things. These men
had a lawn and a garden and tables and chairs. If
you are familiar with the tidiness of a retired New
England sailor, who regards his porch as a quarter-deck
and sallies forth to remove each descending
autumn leaf from the grass, then you know how scrupulous
they were about litter.</p>

<p>For weeks they had been in the same position, unseen
by German aeroplanes. They had daily baths;
they did their week’s washing, taking care not to hang
it where it would be visible from the sky. Every
day they received London papers and letters from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
home. When they were needed to help in making
war, all they had to do was to slip a shell in the breech
and send it with their compliments to the Germans.
They were camping out at His Majesty’s expense in
the pleasant land of France in the joyous summer
time; and on the roof of sods over their guns were
pots of flowers, undisturbed by blasts from the gun-muzzles.</p>

<p>It was when leaving another battery that, out of the
tail of my eye, I caught a lurid flash through a hedge,
followed by the sharp, ear-piercing crack that comes
from being in line with a gun-muzzle when a shot is
fired. We followed a path which took us to the rear
of the report, where, through undergrowth, we
stepped among the busy groups around the breeches of
some guns of one of the larger calibres.</p>

<p>An order for some “heavy stuff” at a certain point
on the map was being filled. Sturdy men were moving
in a pantomime under the shade of a willow tree, each
doing exactly his part in a process that seemed as
simple as opening a cupboard door, slipping in a package
of concentrated destruction, and closing the door
again. All that detail of range-finding and mathematical
adjustment of aim at the unseen target which
takes so long to explain was applied as automatically
as an adding-machine adds up a column of figures.
Everybody was as practice-perfect in his part as performers
who have made hundreds of appearances in
the same act on the stage.</p>

<p>All ready, the word given, a crack, and through the
air in front you saw a wingless, black object rising in
a curve against the soft blue sky, which it seemed to
sweep with a sound something like the escape of water
through a break in the garden hose, multiplied by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
ten, rising to its zenith and then descending till it
passed out of sight behind a green bank of foliage on
the horizon.</p>

<p>After the scream had been lost to the ear you heard
the faint, thudding boom of an explosion from the
burst of that conical piece of steel which you had seen
slipped into the breech. This was the gunners’ part
in chess-board war, where the moves are made over
signal wires, while the infantry endure the explosions
in their trenches and fight in their charges in the
traverses of the trenches at as close quarters as in the
days of the cave-dwellers.</p>

<p>There was no stopping work when the general came,
of course. It would have been the same had Lord
Kitchener been present. The battery commander expressed
his regret that he could not show me his guns
without any sense of irony; meaning that he was sorry
he was too busy to tell me more about his battery. In
about the time that it took a telegraph key to click
after each one of those distant bursts, he knew
whether or not the shot was on the target and what
variation of degree to make in the next if it were not;
or if the word came to shift the point of aim a little,
when you are trying to shake the enemy up here and
there along a certain length of trench.</p>

<p>At another wire-end some one was spotting the
bursts. Perhaps he was in the kind of place where I
once found an observer, who was sitting upon a cushion
looking out through a chink broken in a wall, with a
signal corps operator near by. It was a small chink,
just large enough to allow the lens of a pair of glasses
or a telescope a range of vision; and even then I was
given certain warnings before the cover over the
chink was removed, though there could not have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
any German in uniform nearer than four thousand
yards. But there may be spies within your own lines,
looking for such holes.</p>

<p>From this post I could make out the German and
the British trenches in muddy white lines of sandbags
running snake-like across the fields, and the officer
identified points on the map to me. Every tree and
hedge and ditch in the panorama were graven on his
mind; all had language for him. His work was engrossing.
It had risk, too; there was no telling when
a shell might lift him off the cushion and provide a
hole for his remains. If he were shelled, the observer
would go to a funk pit, as the gunners do, until the
storm had passed; and then he would move on with his
cushion and his telegraph instrument and make a hole
in another wall, if he did not find a tree or some other
eminence which suited his taste better. Meanwhile,
he was not the only observer in that section. There
were others nearer the trenches, perhaps actually in the
trenches. The two armies, seeming chained to their
trenches, are set with veiled eyes at the end of wires;
veiled eyes trying to locate the other’s eyes, the other’s
guns and troops, and the least movement which indicates
any attempt to gain an advantage.</p>

<p>“Gunnery is navigation, dead reckoning, with the
spotting observer the sun by which you correct your
reckoning,” said one of the artillery officers.</p>

<p>Firing enough one had seen&mdash;landscape bathed in
smoke and dust and reverberating with explosions; but
all as a spectacle from the orchestra seat, not too close
at hand for comfort. This time I was to see the guns
fire and then I was to see the results of the firing in detail.
Both can rarely be seen at the same time. It
was not show firing, this that we watched from an observing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
station, but part of the day’s work for the guns
and the general. First; the map; “here and there,”
as an officer’s finger pointed; and then one looked
across the fields, green and brown and golden with
summer crops.</p>

<p>Item I. The Germans were fortifying a certain
point on a certain farm. We were going to put some
“heavy stuff” in there and some “light stuff,” too.
The burst of our shells could be located in relation to a
certain tree.</p>

<p>Item II. Our planes thought that the Germans had
a wireless station in a certain building. “Heavy
stuff” exclusively for this.</p>

<p>No enemy’s wireless station ought to be enjoying
serene summer weather without interruption; and no
German working party ought to be allowed to build
redoubts within range of our guns without a break
in the monotony of their drudgery.</p>

<p>Six lyddites were the order for the wireless station;
six high explosives which burst on contact and make
a hole in the earth large enough for a grave for the
Kaiser and all his field marshals. Frequently, not
only the number of shells to be fired, but also the intervals
between them is given by the artillery commander,
as a part of his plan in his understanding of
the object to be accomplished; and it is quite clear
that the system is the same with the Germans.</p>

<p>One side no sooner develops an idea than the other
adopts it. By the effect of the enemy’s shells you
judge what the effect of yours must be. Months of
experience have done away with all theory and practice
has become much the same with either adversary.
For example, let a German or a British airman be
winged by anti-aircraft gun-fire and the enemy’s guns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
instantly loosen up on the point over his own lines,
if he regains them, where he is seen to fall. All the
soldiers in the neighbourhood are expected to run to
his assistance; and, at any rate, you may kill a trained
aviator, whose life is a valuable asset on one side of
the ledger and whose death an asset on the other.
There is no sentiment left in war, you see. It is all
killing and avoiding being killed.</p>

<p>By the scream of a shell the practised ear of the
artilleryman can tell whether it comes from a gun
with a low trajectory or from a howitzer, whose projectile
rises higher and falls at a sharper angle which
enables it to enter the trenches; and he can even tell
approximately the calibre.</p>

<p>A scream sweeping past from our rear, and we knew
that this was for the redoubt, as that was to have the
first turn. A volume of dust and smoke breaking
from the earth short of the redoubt; a second’s delay
of hearing the engine whistle after the burst of steam
in the distance on a winter day, and then the sound
of the burst. The next was over. With the third
the “heavy stuff” ought to be right on.</p>

<p>But don’t forget that there was also an order for
some “light stuff,” identified as shrapnel by its soft,
nimbus-like puff which was scattering bullets as if giving
chase to that working party as it hastened to cover.
There you had the ugly method of this modern artillery
fire: death shot downward from the air and leaping
up out of the earth. Unhappily, the third was
not on, nor the fourth&mdash;not exactly on. Exactly on
is the way the British gunners like to fill an order
f.o.b., express charges prepaid, for the Germans.</p>

<p>Ten years ago it would have seemed good shooting.
It was not very good in the twelfth month of the war;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
for war beats the target range in developing accuracy.
At five or six or seven or eight thousand yards’ range
the shells were bursting thirty or forty yards away
from where they should.</p>

<p>No, not very good; the general murmured as much.
He did not need to say so aloud to the artillery officer
responsible for the shooting, who was in touch
with his batteries by wire. The officer knew it. He
was the high-strung, ambitious sort. You had better
not become a gunner unless you are. Any good-enough
temperament is ruled off wasting munitions.
Red was creeping through the tan from his throat to
the roots of his hair. To have this happen in the
presence of that quiet-mannered general, after all his
efforts to remedy the error in those guns!</p>

<p>But the general was quite human. He was not the
“strafing” kind.</p>

<p>“I know those guns have an error!” he said, as he
put his hand on the officer’s arm. That was all; but
that was a good deal to the officer. Evidently, the
general not only knew guns; he knew men. The officer
had suffered admonition enough from his own injured
pride.</p>

<p>Besides, what we did to the supposed wireless station
ought to keep any general from being down-hearted.
Neither guns, nor the powder which sent
the big shells on their errand, nor the calculations of
the gunner, nor the adjustment of the gadgets, had
any error. With the first shot, a great burst of the
black smoke of deadly lyddite rose from the target.</p>

<p>“Right on!”</p>

<p>And again and again&mdash;right on!</p>

<p>The ugly, spreading, low-hanging, dense cloud was
renewed from its heart by successive bursts in the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
place. If the aeroplane’s conclusions were right, that
wireless station must be very much wireless, now.
The only safe discount for the life insurance of the
operators was one hundred per cent.</p>

<p>“Here, they are firing more than six!” said the
general. “It’s always hard to hold gunners down
when they are on the target like that.”</p>

<p>He spoke as if it would have been difficult for him
to resist the temptation himself. The Germans got
two extra for full measure. Perhaps those two were
waste; perhaps the first two had been enough. Conservation
of shells has become a first principle of the
artillerists’ duty. The number fired by either side in
the course of the routine of an average so-called
peaceful day is surprising. Economy would be easier
if it were harder to slip a shell into a gun-breech. The
men in the trenches are always calling for shells.
They want a tree or a house which is the hiding-place
of a sniper knocked down. The men at the guns
would be glad to accommodate them, but the say as
to that is with commanders who know the situation.</p>

<p>“The <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boches</i> will be coming back at us soon, you
will see!” said one of the officers at our observation
post. “They always do. The other day they chose
this particular spot for their target”&mdash;which was a
good reason why they would not this time, an optimist
thought.</p>

<p>Let either side start a bombardment and the other
responds. There is a you-hit-me-and-I’ll-hit-you character
to siege warfare. Gun-fire provokes gun-fire.
Neither adversary stays quiet under a blow. It was
not long before we heard the whish of German shells
passing some distance away.</p>

<p>They say the sport is out of war. Perhaps, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
not its enthralling and horrible fascination. Knowing
what the target is, knowing the object of the fire, hearing
the scream of the projectile on the way and watching
to see if it is to be a hit, when the British are
fighting the Germans on the soil of France, has an
intensive thrill which is missing to the spectator who
looks on at the Home Sports’ Club shooting at clay
pigeons&mdash;which is not in justification of war. It
does explain, however, the attraction of gunnery to
gunners. One forgets for the instant that men are
being killed and mangled. He thinks only of points
being scored in a contest which requires all the wit
and strength and fortitude of man and all his cunning
in the manufacture and control of material.</p>

<p>You want your side to win; in this case, because it
is the side of humanity and of that quiet, kindly general
and the things that he and the army he represents
stand for. The blows which the demons from the
British lairs strike are to you the blows of justice;
and you are glad when they go home. They are
your blows. You have a better reason for keeping an
army’s artillery secrets than for keeping secret the
signals of your Varsity football team, which any one
instinctly keeps&mdash;the reason of a world cause.</p>

<p>Yet another thing to see&mdash;an aeroplane assisting a
battery by spotting the fall of its shells, which is engrossing,
too, and amazingly simple. Of course, this
battery was proud of its method of concealment.
Each battery commander will tell you that one of the
British planes has flown very low, as a test, without
being able to locate his battery. If the plane does
locate it, there is more work due in “make-up” to
complete the disguise. Competition among batteries
is as keen as among battleships of the North Atlantic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
Situation favoured this battery, which was Canadian.
It was as nicely at home as a first-class Adirondack
camp. At any rate, no other battery had a dugout
for a litter of eight pups, with clean straw for
their bed, right between two gun-emplacements.</p>

<p>“We found the mother wild out there in the
woods,” one of the men explained. “She, too, was
a victim of war; a refugee from some home destroyed
by shell-fire. At first she wouldn’t let us approach
her, and we tossed her pieces of meat from a safe
distance. I think those pups will bring us luck.
We’ll take them along to the Rhine. Some mascots,
eh?”</p>

<p>On our way back to the general’s headquarters
we must have passed other batteries hidden from
sight only a stone’s throw away; and yet in an illustrated
paper recently I saw a drawing of some guns
emplaced on the crest of a bare hill, naked to all the
batteries of the enemy but engaged in destroying all
the enemy’s batteries, according to the account.
Eleven months of war have not shaken conventional
ideas about gunnery; which is one reason for writing
this chapter.</p>

<p>Also, on our way back we learned the object of
the German fire in answer to our bombardment of
the redoubt and the wireless station. They had
shelled a cross-roads and a certain village again. As
we passed through the village we noticed a new hole
in the church tower and three holes in the churchyard,
which had scattered clods of earth about the pavement.
A shopkeeper across the street was engaged
in repairing a window-frame that had been broken
by a shell-fragment.</p>

<p>There is no flustering the French population. That<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>
very day I heard of an old peasant, who asked a
British soldier if he could not get permission for the
old man to wear some kind of an armband which
both sides would respect, so that he could cut his
field of wheat between the trenches. Why not?
Wasn’t it his wheat? Didn’t he need the crop?</p>

<p>The Germans fire into villages and towns; for the
women and children there are the women and children
of the enemy. But those in the German lines belong
to the ally of England. Besides, they are women
and children. So British gunners avoid the towns&mdash;which
is, in one sense, a professional handicap.</p></div>

<p>The anti-aeroplane gun&mdash;Tricks of the trade&mdash;The vagabond of the
army lines&mdash;Before the days of Archibald&mdash;Pie for the Taube&mdash;“Swaggerest”
of the gun tribe&mdash;Sport of war&mdash;Puffs in the
blue&mdash;Difficulty of accuracy&mdash;“Sending the prying aerial eye
home”&mdash;The business of planes.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is another kind of gun, vagrant and free lance,
which deserves a chapter by itself. It has the same
bark as the eighteen-pounder field piece; the flight of
the shell makes the same kind of sound. But its
scream, instead of passing in a long parabola toward
the German lines, goes up in the heavens toward
something as large as your hand against the light
blue of the summer sky&mdash;a German aeroplane.</p>

<p>At a height of seven or eight thousand feet the
target seems almost stationary, when really it is going
somewhere between fifty and ninety miles an hour. It
has all the heavens to itself, and to the British it is a
sinister, prying eye that wants to see if we are building
any new trenches, if we are moving bodies of
troops or of transport in some new direction, and
where our batteries are in hiding. That aviator three
miles above the earth has many waiting guns at his
command. A few signals from his wireless and they
would let loose on the target he indicated.</p>

<p>If the planes might fly as low as they pleased, they
would know all that was going on in an enemy’s lines.
They must keep up so high that through the aviator’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
glasses a man on the road is the size of a pin-head.
To descend low is as certain death as to put your
head over the parapet of a trench when the enemy’s
trench is only a hundred yards away. There are dead
lines in the air, no less than on the earth.</p>

<p>Archibald, the anti-aircraft gun, sets the dead line.
He watches over it as a cat watches a mouse. The
trick of sneaking up under cover of a noon-day cloud
and all the other man-bird tricks he knows. A couple
of seconds after that crack a tiny puff of smoke breaks
about a hundred yards behind the Taube. A soft
thistleblow against the blue it seems at that altitude;
but it wouldn’t if it were about your ears. Then it
would sound like a bit of dynamite on an anvil struck
by a hammer and you would hear the whiz of scores
of bullets and fragments.</p>

<p>The smoking brass shell-case is out of Archibald’s
steel throat and another shell-case with its charge
slipped into place and started on its way before the
first puff breaks. The aviator knows what is coming.
He knows that one means many, once he is in range.</p>

<p>Archibald rushes the fighting; it is the business of
the Taube to sidestep. The aviator cannot hit back
except through his allies, the German batteries, on
the earth. They would take care of Archibald if
they knew where he was. But all that the aviator
can see is mottled landscape. From his side Archibald
flies no goal flags. He is one of ten thousand
tiny objects under the aviator’s eye.</p>

<p>Archibald’s propensities are entirely peripatetic.
He is the vagabond of the army lines. Locate him
and he is gone. His home is where night finds him
and the day’s duties take him. He is the only gun
that keeps regular hours like a Christian gentleman.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>
All the others, great and small, raucous-voiced and
shrill-voiced, fire at any hour, night or day. Aeroplanes
rarely go up at night; and when no aeroplanes
are up, Archibald has no interest in the war. But
he is alert at the first flush of dawn, on the lookout for
game with the avidity of a pointer dog; for aviators
are also up early.</p>

<p>Why he was named Archibald nobody knows. As
his full name is Archibald the Archer, possibly it
comes from some association with the idea of archery.
If there were ten thousand anti-aircraft guns in the
British army, every one would be known as Archibald.
When the British Expeditionary Force went to France
it had none. All the British could do was to bang
away at Taubes with thousands of rounds of rifle-bullets,
which might fall in their own lines, and with the
field guns.</p>

<p>It was pie in those days for the Taubes! Easy to
keep out of the range of both rifles and guns and observe
well! If the Germans did not know the progress
of the British retreat from on high it was their
own fault. Now, the business of firing at Taubes is
left entirely to Archibald. When you see how hard it
is for Archibald, after all his practice, to get a Taube,
you understand how foolish it was for the field guns
to try to get one.</p>

<p>Archibald, who is quite the “swaggerest” of the
gun tribe, has his own private car built especially for
him. Such of the cavalry’s former part as the planes
do not play he plays. He keeps off the enemy’s
scouts. Do you seek team-work, spirit of corps, and
smartness in this theatre of France, where all the old
glamour of war is supposed to be lacking? You will
find it in the attendants of Archibald. They have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>
pride, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élan</i>, alertness, pepper, and all the other appetisers
and condiments. They are as neat as a private
yacht’s crew and as lively as an infield of a major
league team. The Archibaldians are naturally bound
to think rather well of themselves.</p>

<p>Watch them there, every man knowing his part, as
they send their shells after the Taube! There is not
enough waste motion among the lot to tip over the
range-finder, or the telescopes, or the score board,
or any of the other paraphernalia assisting the man
who is looking through the sight in knowing where to
aim next, as a screw answers softly to his touch.</p>

<p>Is the sport of war dead? Not for Archibald!
Here you see your target&mdash;which is so rare these
days when British infantrymen have stormed and
taken trenches without ever seeing a German&mdash;and
the target is a bird, a man-bird. Puffs of smoke with
bursting hearts of death are clustered around the
Taube. One follows another in quick succession, for
more than one Archibald is firing, before your entranced
eyes.</p>

<p>You are staring like the crowd of a county fair
at a parachute act. For the next puff may get him.
Who knows this better than the aviator? He is,
likely, an old hand at the game; or, if he is not, he
has all the experience of other veterans to go by.
His ruse is the same as that of the escaped prisoner,
who runs from the fire of a guard in a zigzag course,
and more than that. If a puff comes near on the
right, he turns to the left; if one comes near on the
left, he turns to the right; if one comes under, he
rises; over, he dips. This means that the next shell
fired at the same point will be wide of the target.</p>

<p>Looking through the sight, it seems easy to hit a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span>
plane. But here is the difficulty. It takes two seconds,
say, for the shell to travel to the range of the
plane. The gunner must wait for its burst before he
can spot his shot. Ninety miles an hour is a mile
and a half a minute. Divide that by thirty and you
have about a hundred yards which the plane has travelled
from the time the shell left the gun-muzzle till
it burst. It becomes a matter of discounting the
aviator’s speed and guessing from experience which
way he will turn next.</p>

<p>That ought to have got him&mdash;the burst was right
under. No! He rises. Surely that one got him!
The puff is right in front, partly hiding the Taube
from view. You see the plane tremble as if struck
by a violent gust of wind. Close! Within thirty or
forty yards, the telescope says. But at that range the
naked eye is easily deceived about distance. Probably
some of the bullets have cut his plane.</p>

<p>But you must hit the man or the machine in a vital
spot in order to bring down your bird. The explosions
must be very close to count. It is amazing how
much shell-fire an aeroplane can stand. Aviators are
accustomed to the whiz of shell-fragments and bullets
and to have their planes punctured and ripped.
Though their engines are put out of commission, and
frequently though the men be wounded, they are able
to volplane back to the cover of their own lines.</p>

<p>To make a proper story we ought to have brought
down this particular bird. But it had the luck, which
most planes, British or German, have, to escape anti-aircraft
gun-fire. It had begun edging away after the
first shot and soon was out of range. Archibald had
served the purpose of his existence. He had sent the
prying aerial eye home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
A fight between planes in the air very rarely happens,
except in the imagination. Planes do not go up
to fight other planes, but for observation. Their business
is to see and learn and bring home their news.</p></div>

<span class="subhead">TRENCHES IN SUMMER</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>General Mud “down and out”&mdash;“What hopes!”&mdash;Heroes in khaki&mdash;“Tickets
to England”&mdash;Coddling at home&mdash;Comradeship
among the men&mdash;The uses of barbed wire&mdash;“Your hat, sir!”&mdash;Sniping&mdash;Sentimental

<p>It was the same trench in June, still a relatively “quiet
corner,” which I had seen in March; but I would never
have known it if its location had not been the same
on the map. One was puzzled how a place that had
been so wet could become so dry.</p>

<p>This time the approach was made in daylight
through a long communication ditch, which brought us
to a shell-wrecked farmhouse. We passed through
this and stepped down at the back door into deep traverses
cut among the roots of an orchard; then behind
walls of earth high above our heads to battalion headquarters
in a neat little shanty, where I deposited the
first of the cakes I had brought, on the table beside
some battalion reports. A cake is the right gift for
the trenches, though less so in summer than in winter
when appetites are less keen. The adjutant tried a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>
slice while the colonel conferred with the general, who
had accompanied me this far; and he glanced up at a
sheet of writing with a line opposite hours of the day,
pinned to a post of his dugout.</p>

<p>“I wanted to see if it were time to make another
report,” he said. “We are always making reports.
Everybody is, so that whoever is superior to some one
else knows what is happening in his subordinate’s department.”</p>

<p>Then in and out in a maze, between walls with
straight faces on the hard, dry earth, testifying to the
beneficence of summer weather in constructing fastnesses
from artillery fire, until we were in the firing-trench,
where I was at home among the officers and
men of a company. General Mud was “down and
out.” He waited on the winter rains to take command
again. But winter would find an army prepared
against his kind of campaign. Life in the trenches
in summer was not so unpleasant but that some preferred
it, with the excitement of sniping, to the boredom
of billets.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>“What hopes!” was the current phrase I heard
among the men in these trenches. It shared honours
with <em>strafe</em>. You have only one life to live and you
may lose that any second&mdash;what hopes! Dig, dig,
dig, and set off a mine that sends Germans skyward
in a cloud of dust&mdash;what hopes! Bully beef from
Chicago and Argentina is no food for babes, but better
than “K.K.” bread&mdash;what hopes! Mr. Thomas
Atkins, British regular, takes things as they come&mdash;and
a lot of them come&mdash;shells, bullets, asphyxiating
gas, grenades, and bombs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>
There is much to be thankful for. The King’s
Own Particular Fusiliers, as we shall call this regiment,
had only three men hit yesterday. On every man’s
cap is a metal badge crowded with battle honours,
from the storming of Quebec to the relief of Ladysmith.
Heroic its history; but no battle honours equal
that of the regiment’s part in the second battle of
Ypres; and no heroes of the regiment’s story, whom
you picture in imagination with halos of glory in the
wish that you might have met them in the flesh in
their scarlet coats, are the equal of these survivors in
plain khaki manning a ditch in <span class="smcap">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1915, whom any
one may meet.</p>

<p>But do not tell them that they are heroes. They
will deny it on the evidence of themselves as eye-witnesses
of the action. To remark that the K.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;F.
are brave is like remarking that water flows down
hill. It is the business of the K.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;F. to be
brave. Why talk about it?</p>

<p>One of the three men hit was killed. Well, everybody
in the war rather expects to be killed. The
other two “got tickets to England,” as they say. My
lady will take the convalescents joy riding in her car
and afterwards seat them in easy chairs, arranging
the cushions with her own hands, and feed them slices
of cold chicken in place of bully beef and strawberries
and cream in place of ration marmalade. Oh, my!
What hopes!</p>

<p>Mr. Atkins does not mind being a hero for the purposes
of such treatment. Then, with never a twinkle
in his eye, he will tell my lady that he does not want
to return to the front; he has had enough of it, he
has. My lady’s patriotism will be a trifle shocked,
as Mr. Atkins knows it will be; and she will wonder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>
if the “stick it” quality of the British soldier is
weakening, as Mr. Atkins knows she will. For he
has more kinks in his mental equipment than mere nobility
ever guesses and he is having the time of his
life in more respects than strawberries and cream.
What hopes! Of course, he will return and hold on
in the face of all that the Germans can give, without
any pretence to bravery.</p>

<p>If one goes as a stranger into the trenches on a
sightseeing tour and says, “How are you?” and,
“Are you going to Berlin?” and, “Are you comfortable?”
etc., Tommy Atkins will say, “Yes, sir,” and
“Very well, sir,” etc., as becomes all polite regular
soldier men; and you get to know him about as well as
you know the members of a club if you are shown
the library and dine at a corner table with a
friend.</p>

<p>Spend the night in the trenches and you are taken
into the family; into that very human family of soldierdom
in a quiet corner; and the old, care-free
spirit of war, which some people thought had passed,
is found to be no less alive in siege warfare than on
a march of regulars on the Indian frontier or in the
Philippines. Gaiety and laughter and comradeship
and “joshing” are here among men to whom wounds
and death are a part of the game. One may challenge
high explosives with a smile, no less than ancient round
shot. Settle down behind the parapet and the little
incongruities of a trench, paltry without the intimacy
of men and locality, make for humour no less than in
a shop or a factory.</p>

<p>Under the parapet runs the tangle of barbed wire&mdash;barbed
wire from Switzerland to Belgium&mdash;to welcome
visitors from that direction, which, to say the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>
least, would be an impolitic direction of approach for
any stranger.</p>

<p>“All sightseers should come into the trenches from
the rear,” says Mr. Atkins. “Put it down in the
guidebooks.”</p>

<p>Beyond the barbed wire in the open field the wheat
which some farmer sowed before the positions were
established in this area is now in head, rippling with
the breeze, making a golden sea up to the wall of
sandbags which is the enemy’s line. It was late June
at its loveliest; no signs of war except the sound of
our guns some distance away and an occasional sniper’s
bullet. One cracked past as I was looking
through my glasses to see if there were any evidence
of life in the German trenches.</p>

<p>“Your hat, sir!”</p>

<p>Another moved a sandbag slightly, but not until
after the hat had come down and the head under it
most expeditiously. Up to eight hundred yards a
bullet cracks; beyond that range it whistles, sighs, even
wheezes. An elevation gives snipers, who are always
trained shots, an angle of advantage. In winter they
had to rely for cover on buildings, which often came
tumbling down with them when hit by a shell. The
foliage of summer is a boon to their craft.</p>

<p>“Does it look to you like an opening in the branches
of that tree&mdash;the big one at the right?”</p>

<p>In the mass of leaves a dark spot was visible. It
might be natural, or it might be a space cut away for
the swing of a rifle barrel. Perhaps sitting up there
snugly behind a bullet-proof shield fastened to the
limbs was a German sharpshooter, watching for a
shot with the patience of a hound for a rabbit to come
out of its hole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>
“It’s about time we gave that tree a spray good for
that kind of fungus, from a machine gun!”</p>

<p>A bullet coming from our side swept overhead.
One of our own sharpshooters had seen something to
shoot at.</p>

<p>“Not giving you much excitement!” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“I suppose I’d get a little if I stood up on the
parapet?” I asked.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t get a ticket for England; you’d get
a box!”</p>

<p>“There’s a cemetery just back of the lines if you’d
prefer to stay in France!”</p>

<p>I had passed that cemetery with its fresh wooden
crosses on my way to the trench. These tender-hearted
soldiers who joked with death had placed flowers
on the graves of fallen comrades and bought elaborate
French funeral wreaths with their meagre pay&mdash;which
is another side of Mr. Thomas Atkins. There
is sentiment in him. Yes, he’s loaded with sentiment,
but not for the movies.</p>

<p>“Keep your head down there, Eames!” called a
corporal. “I don’t want to be taking an inventory
of your kit.”</p>

<p>Eames did not even realise that his head was above
the parapet. The hardest thing to teach a soldier is
not to expose himself. Officers keep iterating warnings
and then forget to practise what they preach.
That morning a soldier had been shot through the
heart and arm sideways back of the trench. He had
lain down unnoticed for a nap in the sun, it was supposed.
When he awoke, presumably he sat up and
yawned and Herr Schmidt, from some platform in a
tree, had a bloody reward for his patience.</p>

<p>The next morning I saw the British take their revenge.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>
Some German who thought that he could not
be seen in the mist of dawn was walking along the
German parapet. What hopes! Four or five men
took careful aim and fired. That dim figure collapsed
in a way that was convincing.</p>

<p>As I swept the line of German trenches with the
glasses, I saw a wisp of a flag clinging to its pole in
the still air far down to the left. Flags are as unusual
above trenches as men standing up in full view of the
enemy. Then a breeze caught the folds of the flag
and I saw that it was the tricolour of France.</p>

<p>“A <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boche</i> joke!” Tommy explained.</p>

<p>“Probably they are hating the French to-day?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s been there for some days. They want
us to shoot at the flag of our ally. They’d get a
laugh out of that&mdash;a regular Boche notion of humour.”</p>

<p>“If it were a German flag?” I suggested.</p>

<p>“What hopes! We’d make it into a lace curtain!”</p>

<p>Even the guns had ceased firing. The birds in their
evensong had all the war to themselves. It was difficult
to believe that if you stood on top of the parapet
anybody would shoot at you; no, not even if you
walked down the road that ran through the wheat-field,
everything was so peaceful. One grew sceptical
of there being any Germans in the trenches opposite.</p>

<p>“There are three or four sharpshooters and a fat
old <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boche</i> professor in spectacles, who moves a machine
gun up and down for a bluff,” said a soldier,
and another corrected him:</p>

<p>“No, the old professor’s the one that walks along
at night sending up flares!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>
“Munching K.K. bread with his false teeth!”</p>

<p>“And singing the hymn of hate!”</p>

<p>Thus the talk ran on in the quiet of evening, till
we heard a concussion and a quarter of a mile away,
behind a screen of trees, a pillar of smoke rose to the
height of two or three hundred feet.</p>

<p>“A mine!”</p>

<p>“In front of the &mdash;th brigade!”</p>

<p>“Ours or the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boches’</i>?”</p>

<p>“Ours, from the way the smoke went&mdash;our fuse!”</p>

<p>“No, theirs!”</p>

<p>Our colonel telephoned down to know if we knew
whose mine it was, which was the question we wanted
to ask him. The guns from both sides became busy
under the column of smoke. Oh, yes, there were
Germans in the trenches which had appeared vacant.
Their shots and ours merged in the hissing medley of
a tempest.</p>

<p>“Not enough guns&mdash;not enough noise for an attack!”
said experienced Tommy, who knew what an
attack was like.</p>

<p>The commander of the adjoining brigade telephoned
to the division commander, who passed the
word through to our colonel, who passed it to us,
that the mine was German and had burst thirty yards
short of the British trench.</p>

<p>“After all that digging, wasting <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boche</i> powder in
that fashion! The Kaiser won’t like it!” said Mr.
Atkins. “We exploded one under them yesterday
and it made them hate so hard they couldn’t wait.
They’ve awful tempers, the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boches</i>!” And he finished
the job on which he was engaged when interrupted,
eating a large piece of ration bread surmounted
by all the ration jam it would hold; while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>
one of the company officers reminded me that it was
about dinner time.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>“What do you think I am? A blooming traffic
policeman?” growled the cook to two soldiers who
had found themselves in a blind alley in the maze of
streets back of the firing-trench. “My word! Is
His Majesty’s army becoming illiterate? <em>Strafe</em> that
sign at the corner! What do you think we put it up
for? To show what a beautiful hand we had at printing?”</p>

<p>The sign on a board fastened against the earth wall
read, “No thoroughfare!” The soldier cook, with
a fork in his hand, his sleeves rolled up, his shirt open
at his tanned throat, looked formidable. He was
preoccupied; he was at close quarters roasting a
chicken over a small stove. Yes, they have cook
stoves in the trenches. Why not? The line had been
in the same position for six months.</p>

<p>“Little by little we improve our happy home,”
said the cook.</p>

<p>The latest acquisition was a lace curtain for the
officers’ mess hall, bought at a store in the nearest
town.</p>

<p>When the cook was inside his kitchen there was no
room to spill anything on the floor. The kitchen was
about three feet square, with boarded walls and roof,
which was covered with tar paper and a layer of
earth set level with the trench parapet. The chicken
roasted and the frying potatoes sizzled as an occasional
bullet passed overhead, even as flies buzz about
the screen door when Mary is baking biscuits for supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a></span>
The officers’ mess hall, next to the kitchen and
built in the same fashion, had some boards nailed on
posts sunk in the ground for a table, which was proof
against tipping when you climbed over it or squeezed
around it to your place. The chairs were rifle-ammunition
boxes, whose contents had been emptied with
individual care, bullet by bullet, at the Germans in
the trench on the other side of the wheat-field. Dinner
was at nine in the evening, when it was still twilight
in the longest day of the year in this region.
The hour fits in with trench routine, when night is the
time to be on guard and you sleep by day. Breakfast
comes at nine in the morning. I was invited to help
eat the chicken and to spend the night.</p>

<p>Now, the general commanding the brigade who accompanied
me to the trenches had been hit twice. So
had the colonel, a man about forty. From forty, ages
among the regimental officers dropped into the twenties.
Many of the older men who started in the
war had been killed, or were back in England wounded,
or had been promoted to other commands where their
experience was more useful. To youth, life is sweet
and danger is life. The oldest of the officers of the
proud old K.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;F. who gathered for dinner was
about twenty-five, though when he assumed an air of
authority he seemed about forty. It was not right to
ask the youngest his age. Parenthetically, let it be
said that he is trying to start a moustache. They had
come fresh from Sandhurst to swift tuition in gruelling,
incessant warfare.</p>

<p>“Has any one asked him it yet?” one inquired, referring
to some question to the guest.</p>

<p>“Not yet? Then all together: When do you
think that the war will be over?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>
It was the eternal question of the trenches, the army
and the world. We had it over with before the soldier
cook brought on the roast chicken, which was
received with a befitting chorus of approbation:</p>

<p>Who would carve? Who knew how to carve?
Modesty passed the honour to its neighbour, till a
brave man said:</p>

<p>“I will! I will <em>strafe</em> the chicken!”</p>

<p><i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Gott strafe England!</i> <em>Strafe</em> has become a noun, a
verb, an adjective, a cussword, and a term of greeting.
Soldier asks soldier how he is strafing to-day. When
the Germans are not called <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boches</i> they are called
Strafers. “Won’t you strafe a little for us?”
Tommy sings out to the German trenches when they
are close. What hopes!</p>

<p>That gallant youngster of the K.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;F. in the
midst of bantering advice succeeded in separating the
meat from the bones without landing a leg in anybody’s
lap or a wing in anybody’s eye. Timid spectators
who had hung back where he had dared might
criticise his form, but they could not deny the efficiency
of his execution. He was appointed permanent
“strafer” of all the fowls that came to table.</p>

<p>Everybody talked and joked about everything, from
plays in London to the Germans. There were arguments
about favourite actors and military methods.
The sense of danger was as absent as if we had been
dining in a summer garden. It was the parents and
relatives in pleasant English homes in fear of a dread
telegram who were worrying, not the sons and brothers
in danger. Isn’t it better that way? Would not
the parents prefer it that way? Wasn’t it the way of
the ancestors in the scarlet coats and the Merrie England
of their day? With the elasticity of youth my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span>
hosts adapted themselves to circumstances. In their
light-heartedness they made war seem a keen sport.
They lived war for all it was worth. If it gets on
their nerves their efficiency is spoiled. There is no
room for a jumpy, excitable man in the trenches.
Youth’s resources defy monotony and death at the
same time.</p>

<p>An expedition had been planned for that night. A
patrol the previous night had brought in word that the
Germans had been sneaking up and piling sandbags in
the wheat-field. The plan was to slip out as soon
as it was really dark with a machine gun and a dozen
men, get behind the Germans’ own sandbags, and give
them a perfectly informal reception when they returned
to go on with their work.</p>

<p>Before dinner, however, J&mdash;&mdash;, who was to be the
general of the expedition, and his subordinates made
a reconnaissance. Two or more officers or men always
go out together on any trip of this kind in that
ticklish space between the trenches, where it is almost
certain death to be seen by the enemy. If one is
hit the other can help him back. If one survives he
will bring back the result of his investigations.</p>

<p>J&mdash;&mdash; had his own ideas about comfort in trousers
in the trench in summer. He wore trunks with his
knees bare. When he had to do a “crawl” he unwound
his puttee leggings and wound them over his
knees. He and the others slipped over the parapet
without attracting the attention of the enemy’s sharpshooters.
On hands and knees, like boy scouts playing
Indian, they passed through a narrow avenue in
the ugly barbed wire, and still not a shot at them. A
matter of the commonplace to the men in the trench
held the spectator in suspense. There was a fascination<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span>
about the thing, too; that of the sporting
chance, without a full realisation that failure in this
hide-and-seek game might mean a spray of bullets
and death for these young men.</p>

<p>They entered the wheat, moving slowly like two
land turtles. The grain parted in swaths over them.
Surely the Germans might see the turtles’ heads as
they were raised to look around. No officer can be
too young and supple for this kind of work. Here
the company officer just out of school is in his element,
with an advantage over older officers. That pair
were used to crawling. They did not keep their heads
up long. They knew just how far they might expose
themselves. They passed out of sight, and reappeared
and slipped back over the parapet again without
the Germans being any the wiser.</p>

<p>Hard luck! It is an unaccommodating world!
They found that the patrol which had examined the
bags at night had failed to discern that they were old
and must have been there for some time.</p>

<p>“I’ll take the machine gun out, anyhow, if the colonel
will permit it,” said J&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>For the colonel puts on the brakes. Otherwise,
there is no telling what risks youth might take with
machine guns.</p>

<p>We were half through dinner when a corporal came
to report that a soldier on watch thought that he
had seen some Germans moving in the wheat very near
our barbed wire. Probably a false alarm; but no
one in a trench ever acts on the theory that any alarm
is false. Eternal vigilance is the price of holding a
trench. Either side is cudgelling its brains day and
night to spring some new trick on the other. If one
side succeeds with a trick, the other immediately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span>
adopts it. No international copyright on strategy is
recognised. We rushed out of the mess hall into the
firing-trench, where we found the men on the alert,
their rifles laid on the spot where the Germans were
supposed to have been seen.</p>

<p>“Who are you? Answer, or we fire!” called the
ranking young lieutenant.</p>

<p>If any persons present out at front in face of thirty
rifles knew the English language and had not lost
the instinct of self-preservation, they would certainly
have become articulate in response to such an unveiled
hint. Not a sound came. Probably a rabbit running
through the wheat had been the cause of the alarm.
But you take no risks. The order was given, and
the men combed the wheat with a fusillade.</p>

<p>“Enough! Cease fire!” said the officer. “Nobody
there. If there had been we should have heard
the groan of a wounded man or seen the wheat stir
as the Germans hugged closer to the earth for cover.”</p>

<p>This he knew by experience. It was not the first
time he had used a fusillade in this kind of a test.</p>

<p>After dinner J&mdash;&mdash; rolled his puttees up around his
bare knees again, for the colonel had not withdrawn
permission for the machine gun expedition. J&mdash;&mdash;’s
knees were black and blue in spots; they were also&mdash;well,
there is not much water for washing purposes
in the trenches. Great sport that, crawling through
the dew-moist wheat in the faint moonlight, looking
for a bunch of Germans in the hope of turning a
machine gun on them before they turn one on you.</p>

<p>“One man hit by a stray bullet,” said J&mdash;&mdash;, on his
return.</p>

<p>“I heard the bullet go th-ip into the earth after it
went through his leg,” said the other officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span>
“Blythe was a recruit and he had asked me to take
him out the first time there was anything doing. I
promised that I would, and he got about the only
shot fired at us.”</p>

<p>“Need a stretcher?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Blythe came hobbling through the traverse to the
communication trench, seeming well pleased with himself.
The soft part of the leg is not a bad place to
receive a bullet if one is due to hit you.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Night is always the time in the trenches when life
grows more interesting and death more likely.</p>

<p>“It’s dark enough, now,” said one of the youngsters
who was out on another scout. “We’ll go out with
the patrol.”</p>

<p>By day, the slightest movement of the enemy is
easily and instantly detected. The light keeps the
combatants to the warrens which protect them from
shell and bullet-fire. At night there is no telling what
mischief the enemy may be up to; you must depend
upon the ear rather than the eye for watching. Then
the human soldier-fox comes out of his burrow and
sneaks forth on the lookout for prey; both sides are
on the prowl.</p>

<p>“Trained owls would be the most valuable scouts
we could have,” said the young officer. “They
would be more useful than aeroplanes in locating the
enemy’s gun positions. A properly reliable owl would
come back and say that a German patrol was out in
the wheat-field at such a point and a machine gun
would wipe out the German patrol.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span>
We turned into a side trench, an alley off the main
street, leading out of the front trench toward the
Germans.</p>

<p>“Anybody out?” he asked a soldier, who was on
guard at the end of it.</p>

<p>“Yes, two.”</p>

<p>Climbing out of the ditch, we were in the midst of
a tangle of barbed wire protecting the trench front,
which was faintly visible in the starlight. There was
a break in the tangle, a narrow cut in the hedge, as it
were, kept open for just such purposes as this. When
the patrol returned it closed the gate again.</p>

<p>“Look out for that wire&mdash;just there! Do you
see it? We’ve everything to keep the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boches</i> off our
front lawn except ‘keep off the grass!’ signs.”</p>

<p>It was perfectly still, a warm summer night without
a cat’s-paw of breeze. Through the dark curtain
of the sky in a parabola rising from the German
trenches swept a brilliant sputter of red light of a
German flare. It was coming as straight toward us
as if it had been aimed at us. It cast a searching, uncanny
glare over the tall wheat in head between the
trenches.</p>

<p>“Down flat!” whispered the officer.</p>

<p>It seemed foolish to grovel before a piece of fireworks.
There was no firing in our neighbourhood;
nothing to indicate a state of war between the British
Empire and Germany; no visual evidence of any German
army anywhere in France except that flare.
However, if a guide, who knows as much about war
as this one, says to prostrate yourself when you are
out between two lines of machine guns and rifles&mdash;between
the fighting powers of Britain and Germany&mdash;you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span>
take the hint. The flare sank into the earth a
few yards away, after a last insulting, ugly fling of
sparks in our faces.</p>

<p>“What if we had been seen?”</p>

<p>“They’d have combed the wheat in this neighbourhood
thoroughly, and they might have got us.”</p>

<p>“It’s hard to believe,” I said.</p>

<p>So it was, he agreed. That was the exasperating
thing about it. Always hard to believe, perhaps, until
after all the cries of wolf the wolf came; until after
nineteen harmless flares the twentieth revealed to the
watching enemy the figure of a man above the wheat,
when a crackling chorus of bullets would suddenly
break the silence of night by concentrating on a target.
Keeping cover from German flares is a part of the
minute, painstaking economy of war.</p>

<p>We crawled on slowly, taking care to make no noise,
till we brought up behind two soldiers hugging the
earth, rifles in hand ready to fire instantly. It was
their business not only to see the enemy first, but to
shoot first, and to capture or kill any German patrol.
The officer spoke to them and they answered. It
was unnecessary for them to say that they had seen
nothing. If they had we should have known it. He
was out there less to scout himself than to make sure
that they were on the job; that they knew how to
watch. The visit was part of his routine. We did
not even whisper. Preferably, all whispering would
be done by any German patrol out to have a look at
our barbed wire and overheard by us.</p>

<p>Silence and the starlight and the damp wheat; but,
yes, there was war. You heard gun-fire half a mile,
perhaps a mile, away; and raising your head you saw
auroras from bursting shells. We heard at our backs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">307</a></span>
faintly snatches of talk from our trenches and faintly
in front the talk from theirs. It sounded rather inviting
and friendly from both sides, like that around
some campfire on the plains.</p>

<p>It seemed quite within the bounds of probability that
you might have crawled on up to the Germans and
said, “Howdy!” But by the time you reached the
edge of their barbed wire and before you could present
your visiting-card, if not sooner, you would have
been full of holes. That was just the kind of diversion
from trench monotony for which the Germans
were looking.</p>

<p>“Well, shall we go back?” asked the officer.</p>

<p>There seemed no particular purpose in spending
the night prone in the wheat with your ears cocked
like a pointer dog’s. Besides, he had other duties,
exacting duties laid down by the colonel as the result
of trench experience in his responsibility for the command
of a company of men.</p>

<p>It happened, as we crawled back into the trench,
that a fury of shots broke out from a point along
the line two or three hundred yards away; sharp,
vicious shots on the still night air, stabbing, merciless
death in their sound. Oh, yes, there was war in
France; unrelenting, shrewd, tireless war. A touch of
suspicion anywhere and the hornets swarmed.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It was two <span class="smcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> From the dugouts came unmistakable
sounds of slumber. Men off duty were
not kept awake by cold and moisture in summer.
They had fashioned for themselves comfortable dormitories
in the hard earth walls. A cot in an officer’s
bed chamber was indicated as mine. The walls<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">308</a></span>
had been hung with cuts from illustrated papers and
bagging spread on the floor to make it “home-like.”
He lay down on the floor because he was nearer the
door in case he had to respond to an alarm; besides,
he said I would soon appreciate that I was not the
object of any favouritism. So I did. It was a
trench-made cot, fashioned by some private of engineers,
I fancy, who had Germans rather than the
American cousin in mind.</p>

<p>“The wall side of the rib that runs down the
middle is the comfortable side, I have found,” said my
host. “It may not appear so at first, but you will
find that it works out that way.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, one slept, his last recollection that of
sniping shots, to be awakened with the first streaks of
day by the sound of a fusillade&mdash;the “morning hate”
or the “morning strafe,” as it was called. After
the vigil of darkness it breaks the monotony to salute
the dawn with a burst of rifle-shots. Eyes
strained through the mist over the wheat-field watching
for some one of the enemy who may be exposing
himself, unconscious that it is light enough for him
to be visible. Objects which are not men but look as
if they might be in the hazy distance, called for attention
on the chance. For ten minutes, perhaps, the
serenade lasted, and then things settled down to the
normal. The men were yawning and stirring from
their dugouts. After the muster they would take the
places of those who had been “on the bridge” through
the night.</p>

<p>“It’s a case of how little water you can wash with,
isn’t it?” I said to the cook, who appreciated my
thoughtfulness when I made shift with a dipperful, as
I had done on desert journeys. We were in a trench<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>
that was inundated with water in winter, and not
more than two miles from a town which had a water
system. But bringing a water supply in pails along
narrow trenches is a poor pastime, though better than
bringing it up under the rifle-sights of snipers across
the fields back of the trenches.</p>

<p>“Don’t expect much for breakfast,” said the <em>strafer</em>
of the chicken. But it was eggs and bacon, the British
stand-by in all weathers, at home and abroad.</p>

<p>J&mdash;&mdash; was going to turn in and sleep. These
youngsters could sleep at any time; for one hour, or
two hours, or five, or ten, if they had a chance. A
sudden burst of rifle-fire was the alarm clock which
always promptly awakened them. The recollection
of cheery hospitality and their fine, buoyant spirit is
even clearer now than when I left the trench.</p></div>

<span class="subhead">A SCHOOL IN BOMBING</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>War specialism&mdash;A school on a French farm&mdash;A lesson&mdash;“Bombing
them out”&mdash;Fighting in zigzag traverses&mdash;Cold steel&mdash;The
bomb storehouse&mdash;All shapes and sizes&mdash;Revivals of Roman
legionary days&mdash;A home-made product&mdash;A fool-proof, up to
the minute and popular (except with the “Boches”) variety.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was at a bombing school on a French farm, where
chosen soldiers brought back from the trenches were
being trained in the use of the anarchists’ weapon,
which has now become as respectable as the rifle. The
war has steadily developed specialism. M.B. degrees
for Master Bombers are not beyond the range of possibilities.</p>

<p>Present was the chief instructor, a young Scotch
subaltern with blue eyes, a pleasant smile, and a Cock
o’ the North spirit. He might have been twenty
years old, though he did not look it. On his breast
was the purple and white ribbon of the new order
of the Military Cross, which you get for doing something
in this war which would have won you a Victoria
Cross in one of the other wars.</p>

<p>Also present was the assistant instructor, a sergeant
of regulars&mdash;and very much of a regular&mdash;who had
three ribbons which he had won in previous campaigns.
He, too, had blue eyes, bland blue eyes. These two
understood each other.</p>

<p>“If you don’t drop it, why, it’s all right!” said the
sergeant. “Of course, if you do&mdash;”</p>

<p>I did not drop it.</p>

<p>“And when you throw it, sir, you must look out and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">311</a></span>
not hit the man behind and knock the bomb out of your
hand. That has happened before to an absent-minded
fellow who was about to toss one at the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boches</i>, and
it doesn’t do to be absent-minded when you throw
bombs.”</p>

<p>“They say that you sometimes pick up the German
bombs and chuck them back before they explode,”
it was suggested.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I’ve read things like that in some of the
accounts of the reporters who write from Somewhere
in France. You don’t happen to know where that is,
sir? All I can say is that if you are going to do it you
must be quick about it. I shouldn’t advise delaying
your decision, sir, or perhaps when you reached
down to pick it up, neither your hand nor the bomb
would be there. They’d have gone off together,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever been hurt in your handling of
bombs?” I asked.</p>

<p>Surprise in the bland blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir! Bombs are well behaved if you
treat them right. It’s all in being thoughtful and
considerate of them!” Meanwhile, he was jerking
at some kind of a patent fuse set in a shell of high
explosive. “This is a poor kind, sir. It’s been discarded,
but I thought that you might like to see it.
Never did like it. Always making trouble!”</p>

<p>More distance between the audience and the performer.</p>

<p>“Now I’ve got it, sir&mdash;get down, sir!”</p>

<p>The audience carried out instructions to the letter,
as army regulations require. It got behind the protection
of one of the practice-trench traverses. He
threw the discard beyond another wall of earth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">312</a></span>
There was a sharp report, a burst of smoke, and some
fragments of earth were tossed into the air.</p>

<p>In a small affair of two hundred yards of trench a
week before, it was estimated that the British and
the Germans together threw about five thousand
bombs in this fashion. It was enough to sadden any
Minister of Munitions. However, the British kept
the trench.</p>

<p>“Do the men like to become bombers?” I asked the
subaltern.</p>

<p>“I should say so! It puts them up in front. It
gives them a chance to throw something, and they
don’t get much cricket in France, you see. We had
a pupil here last week, who broke the throwing record
for distance. He was as pleased as Punch with himself.
A first-class bombing detachment has a lot of
pride of corps.”</p>

<p>To bomb soon became as common a verb with the
army as to bayonet. “We bombed them out” meant
a section of trench taken. As you know, a trench is
dug and built with sandbags in zigzag traverses. In
following the course of a trench it is as if you followed
the sides of the squares of a checkerboard up
and down and across on the same tier of squares.
The square itself is a bank of earth, with the cut on
either side and in front of it. When a bombing party
bombs their way into possession of a section of German
trench, there are Germans under cover of the traverses
on either side. They are waiting around the
corner to shoot the first British head that shows itself.</p>

<p>“It is important that you and not the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boches</i> chuck
the bombs over first,” explained the subaltern.
“Also, that you get them into the right traverse, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">313</a></span>
they may be as troublesome to you as to the enemy.”</p>

<p>With bombs bursting in their faces, the Germans
who are not put out of action are blinded and stunned.
In the moment when they are thus off guard, the aggressors
leap around the corner.</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“Stick ’em, sir!” said the matter-of-fact sergeant.
“Yes, the cold steel is best. And do it first! As Mr.
MacPherson said, it’s very important to do it first.”</p>

<p>It has been found that something short is handy
for this kind of work. In such cramped quarters&mdash;a
ditch six feet deep and from two to three feet broad&mdash;the
rifle is an awkward length to permit of prompt
and skilful use of the bayonet.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, you can mix it up better with something
handy&mdash;to think that British soldiers would come to
fighting like assassins!” said the sergeant. “You
must be spry on such occasions. It’s no time for wool-gathering.”</p>

<p>Not a smile from him or the subaltern all the time.
They were the kind you would like to have along in
a tight corner, whether you had to fight with knives,
fists, or seventeen-inch howitzers.</p>

<p>The sergeant took us into the storehouse where he
kept his supply of bombs.</p>

<p>“What if a German shell should strike your storehouse?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“Then, sir, I expect that most of the bombs would
be exploded. Bombs are very peculiar in their habits.
What do you think, sir?”</p>

<p>It was no trouble to show stock, as clerks at the
stores say. He brought forth all the different kinds
of bombs that British ingenuity has invented&mdash;but no,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">314</a></span>
not all invented. These would mount into the thousands.
Every British inventor who knows anything
about explosives has tried his hand at a new kind of
bomb. One means all the kinds which the British
War Office has considered worth a practice test. The
spectator was allowed to handle each one as much as
he pleased. There had been occasions, that boyish
Scotch subaltern told me, when the men who were examining
the products of British ingenuity&mdash;well, the
subaltern had sandy hair, too, which heightened the
effect of his blue eye.</p>

<p>There were yellow and green and blue and black
and striped bombs; egg-shaped, barrel-shaped, conical,
and concave bombs; bombs that were exploded by pulling
a string and by pressing a button&mdash;all these to be
thrown by hand, without mentioning grenades and
other larger varieties to be thrown by mechanical
means, which would have made a Chinese warrior of
Confucius’ time or a Roman legionary feel at home.</p>

<p>“This was the first-born,” the subaltern explained,
“the first thing we could lay our hands on when the
close quarters’ trench warfare began.”</p>

<p>It was as out of date as grandfather’s smooth-bore,
the tin-pot bomb that both sides used early in
the winter. A wick was attached to the high explosive,
wrapped in cloth and stuck in an ordinary army
jam can.</p>

<p>“Quite home-made, as you see, sir,” remarked the
sergeant. “Used to fix them up ourselves in the
trenches in odd hours&mdash;saved burying the refuse jam
tins according to medical corps directions&mdash;and you
threw them at the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boches</i>. Had to use a match to
light it. Very old-fashioned, sir. I wonder if that
old fuse has got damp. No, it’s going all right”&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">315</a></span>and
he threw the jam pot, which made a good explosion.
Later, when he began hammering the end
of another, he looked up in mild surprise at the dignified
back-stepping of the spectators.</p>

<p>“Is that fuse out?” some one asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Of course, sir,” he replied. “It’s
safer. But here is the best; we’re discarding the others,”
he went on, as he picked up a bomb.</p>

<p>It was a pleasure to throw this crowning achievement
of experiments. It fitted your hand nicely; it
threw easily; it did the business; it was fool-proof
against a man in love or a war-poet.</p>

<p>“We saw as soon as this style came out,” said the
sergeant, “that it was bound to be popular. Everybody
asks for it&mdash;except the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boches</i>, sir.”</p></div>

<p>It was the best day because one ran the gamut of the

experience&mdash;and oh, the twinkle in that staff officer’s
eye!</p>

<p>It was on a Monday that I first met him in the ballroom
of a large château. Here another officer was
talking over a telephone in an explicit, businesslike
fashion about “sending up more bombs,” while we
looked at maps spread out on narrow, improvised
tables, such as are used for a buffet at a reception.
Those maps showed all the British trenches and all
the German trenches&mdash;spider-web like lines that cunning
human spiders had spun with spades&mdash;in that
region; and where our batteries were and where some
of the German batteries were, if our aeroplane observations
were correct.</p>

<p>To the layman they were simply blue prints, such
as he sees in the office of an engineer or an architect,
or elaborate printed maps with many blue and red pencillings.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">317</a></span>
To the general in command they were alive
with rifle-power and gun-power and other powers mysterious
to us; the sword with which he thrust and
feinted and guarded in the ceaseless fencing of trench
warfare, while higher authorities than he kept their
secrets as he kept his and bided their day.</p>

<p>That morning one of the battalions which had its
pencilled place on the map had taken a section of
trench from the Germans about the length of two city
blocks. It got into the official bulletins of both sides
several times, this two hundred yards at Pilken in
the everlastingly “hot corner” north of Ypres. So
it was of some importance, though not on account of
its length.</p>

<p>To take two hundred yards of trench because it is
two hundred yards of trench is not good war, tacticians
agree. Good war is to have millions of shells and
vast reserves ready and to go in over a broad area and
keep on going night and day, with a Niagara of artillery,
as fresh battalions are fed into the conflict.</p>

<p>But the Germans had command of some rising
ground in front of the British line at this point. They
could fire down into our trench and crosswise of it. It
was as if we were in the alley and they were in a first-floor
window. This meant many casualties. It was
man-economy and fire-economy to take that two hundred
yards. A section of trench may always be taken
if worth while. Reduce it to dust with shells and then
dash into the breach and drive the enemy back from
zigzag traverse to traverse with bombs. But such a
small action requires as careful planning as a big operation
of other days. We had taken the two hundred
yards. The thing was to hold them. That is always
the difficulty; for the enemy will concentrate his guns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">318</a></span>
to give you the same dose that you gave him. In an
hour after they were in, the British soldiers, who
knew exactly what they had to do and how to do it
after months of experience, had turned the wreck of
the German trenches into a British trench which faced
toward Berlin, rather than Calais.</p>

<p>In their official bulletin the Germans said that they
had recovered the trench. They did recover part of
it for a few hours. It was then that the commander
on the German side must have sent in his report to
catch the late evening editions. Commanders do not
like to confess the loss of trenches. It is the sort of
thing that makes Headquarters ask: “What is the
matter with you over there, anyway?” There was a
time when the German bulletins about the Western
front seemed rather truthful; but of late they have
been getting into bad habits.</p>

<p>The British general knew what was coming; he
knew that he would start the German hornets out of
their nest when he took the trench; he knew, too, that
he could rely upon his men to hold till they were told
to retire or there were none left to retire. The British
are a home-loving people, who do not like to be
changing their habitations. In succeeding days the
question up and down the lines was, “Have we still
got that trench?” Only two hundred yards of ditch
on the continent of Europe! But was it still ours?
Had the Germans succeeded in “strafing” us out of
it yet? They had shelled all the trenches in the region
of the lost trench and had made three determined
and unsuccessful counter-attacks when, on the fifth day,
we returned to the château to ask if it were practicable
to visit the new trench.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">319</a></span>
“At your own risk!” said the staff officer. If we
preferred we could sit on the veranda where there
were easy chairs, on a pleasant summer day. Very
peaceful the sweep of the well-kept grounds and the
shade of the stately trees of that sequestered world of
landscape. Who was at war? Why was any one at
war? Two staff automobiles awaiting orders on the
drive and a dust-laden despatch rider with messages,
who went past toward the rear of the house, were
the only visual evidence of war.</p>

<p>The staff officer served the three of us with helmets
for protection in case we got into a gas attack. He
said that we might enter our front trenches at a certain
point and then work our way as near the new
part as we could; division headquarters, four or five
miles distant, would show us the way. It was then
that the twinkle in the staff officer’s eye as it looked
straight into yours became manifest. You can never
tell, I have learned, just what a twinkle in a British
staff officer’s eye may portend. These fellows who
are promoted up from the trenches to join the “brain-trust”
in the château, know a great deal more about
what is going on than you can learn by standing in
the road far from the front and listening to the sound
of the guns. We encountered a twinkle in another
eye at division headquarters, which may have been
telephoned ahead along with the instructions, “At
their own risk.”</p>

<p>There are British staff officers who would not mind
pulling a correspondent’s leg on a summer day; though,
perhaps, it was really the Germans who pulled ours,
in this instance. Somebody did remark at some headquarters,
I recall, that, “You never know!” which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">320</a></span>
shows that staff officers do not know everything. The
Germans possess half the knowledge&mdash;and they are
at great pains not to part with their half.</p>

<p>We proceeded in our car along country roads, quiet,
normal country roads, off the main highway. It has
been written again and again, and it cannot be written
too many times, that life is going on as usual in the
rear of the army. Nothing could be more wonderful
and yet nothing more natural. All the men of fighting
age were absent. White-capped grandmothers,
too old to join the rest of the family in the fields, sat
in doorways sewing. Everybody was at work and
the crops were growing. One never tires of remarking
the fact. It brings you back from the destructive
orgy of war to the simple, constructive things
of life. An industrious people go on cultivating the
land and the land keeps on producing. It is pleasant
to think that the crops of Northern France were good
in 1915. That is cheering news from home for the
soldiers of France at the front.</p>

<p>At an indicated point we left the car to go forward
on foot, and the chauffeur was told to wait for us
at another point. If the car went any farther it
might draw shell-fire. Army authorities know how
far they may take cars with reasonable safety as well
as a pilot knows the rocks and shoals at a harbour
entrance.</p>

<p>There was an end of white-capped grandmothers in
doorways; an end of people working in the fields.
Rents in the roofless walls of unoccupied houses
stared at the passerby. We were in a dead land.
One of two soldiers whom we met coming from the
opposite direction pointed at what looked like a small
miner’s cabin half covered with earth, screened by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">321</a></span>
tree, as the next headquarters which we were seeking
in our progress.</p>

<p>It was not for sightseers to take the time of the
general, who received us at the door of his dugout.
The German guns had concentrated on a section of
his trenches in a way that indicated that another attack
was coming. One company already had suffered
heavy losses. It was an hour of responsibility for
the general, isolated in the midst of silent fields and
houses, waiting for news from a region hidden from
his view by trees and hedges in that flat country. He
might not move from headquarters, for then he would
be out of communication with his command. His
men were being pounded by shells and the inexorable
law of organisation kept him at the rear. Up in the
trench he might have been one helpless human being
in a havoc of shells which had cut the wires. His
place was where he could be in touch with his subordinates
and his superiors.</p>

<p>True, we wanted to go to the trench that the Germans
had lost and his section was the short cut.
Modesty was not the only reason for not taking it.
As we started along a road parallel to the front, the
head of a soldier popped out of the earth and told us
that orders were to walk in the ditch. One judged
that he was less concerned with our fate than with the
likelihood of our drawing fire, which he and the others
in a concealed trench would suffer after we had passed
on.</p>

<p>There were three of us, two correspondents, L&mdash;&mdash;
and myself, and R&mdash;&mdash;, an officer, which is quite
enough for an expedition of this kind. Now we were
finding our own way, with the help of the large scale
army map which had every house, every farm, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">322</a></span>
every group of trees marked. The farms had been
given such names as Joffre, Kitchener, French, Botha,
and others which the Germans would not like. One
cut across fields with the same confidence that, following
a diagram of city streets in a guidebook, he turns
to the left for the public library and to the right for
the museum.</p>

<p>Our own guns were speaking here and there from
their hiding-places; and overhead an occasional German
shrapnel burst. This seemed a waste of the
Kaiser’s munitions, as there was no one in sight. Yet
there was purpose in the desultory scattering of bullets
from on high. They were policing the district; they
were warning the hated British in reserve not to play
cricket in those fields or march along those deserted
roads.</p>

<p>The more bother in taking cover that the Germans
can make the British, the better they like it; and the
British return the compliment in kind. Everything
that harasses your enemy is counted to the good. If
every shell fired had killed a man in this war, there
would be no soldiers left to fight on either side; yet
never have shells been so important in war before.
They can reach the burrowing human beings in shelters
which are bullet-proof; they are the omnipresent
threat of death. The firing of shells from batteries
securely hidden and emplaced represents no cost of
life to your side, only cost of material; which ridicules
the foolish conclusion that machinery and not men
count. It is because man is still the most precious
machine&mdash;a machine that money cannot reproduce&mdash;that
gun machinery is so much in favour, and every
commander wants to use shells as freely as you use
city water when you don’t pay for it by metre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">323</a></span>
Now another headquarters and another general,
also isolated in a dugout, holding the reins of his
wires over a section of line adjoining that of the one
we had just left. Before we proceeded we must look
over his shelter from shell-storms. The only time
that these British generals become boastful is over
their dugouts. They take all the pride in them of
the man who has bought a plot of land and built
himself a home; and like him, they keep on making
improvements and calling attention to them.</p>

<p>I must say that this was one of the best shelters I
have seen anywhere in the tornado belt; and whatever
I am not, I am certainly an expert in dugouts.
Of course, this general, too, said, “At your own
risk!” He was good enough to send a young officer
with us up to the trenches; then we should not
make any mistakes about direction if we wanted to
reach the neighbourhood of the two hundred yards
which we had taken from the Germans. When we
thanked him and said “Good-bye!” he remarked:</p>

<p>“We never say good-bye up here. It does not
sound pleasant. Make it <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">au revoir</i>” And he, too,
had a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>By this time one leg ought to have been so much
longer than the other that one would have walked in
a circle if he had not had a guide.</p>

<p>That battery which had been near the dugout kept
on with its regular firing, its shells sweeping overhead.
We had not gone far before we came to a
board nailed to a tree with the caution, “Keep to the
right!” If you went to the left you might be seen
by the enemy, though we were seeing nothing of him,
nor of our own trenches yet. Every square yard of
this ground had been tried out by actual experience,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">324</a></span>
at the cost of dead and wounded men, till safe lanes
of approach had been found.</p>

<p>Next was a clearing station, where the wounded are
brought in from the trenches for transfer to ambulances.
A glance at the burden on a stretcher just
arriving automatically framed the word, “shell-fire!”
The stains overrunning on tanned skin beyond the
edges of the white bandage were a bright red in the
sunlight. A khaki blouse torn open, or a trousers
leg, or a sleeve cut down the seam, revealing the
white of the first aid and a splash of red, means one
man wounded; and by the ones the thousands come.</p>

<p>Fifty wounded men on the floor of a clearing station
and the individual is lost in the crowd. When you
see the one borne past, if there is nothing else to
distract attention you always ask two questions: Will
he die? Has he been maimed for life? If the answers
to both are No, you feel a sense of triumph, as
if you had seen a human play, built skilfully around a
life to arouse your emotions, turn out happily.</p>

<p>The man has fought in an honourable cause; he
has felt the very touch of death’s fingers. How
happy he is when he knows that he will get well! In
prospect, as his wound heals into the scar which will
be the lasting decoration of his courage, is home and
all that it means and those in it mean to him. What
kind of a home has he, this private soldier? In the
slums, with a slattern wife? Or in a cottage with a
flower garden in front, only a few minutes’ walk from
the green fields of the English countryside?&mdash;but we
set out to tell you about the kind of inferno in which
this man got his splash of red.</p>

<p>We come to the banks of a canal which has carried
the traffic of the Low Countries for many centuries;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">325</a></span>
the canal where the British and French had fought
many a Thermopylæ in the last eight months. Along
its banks run rows of fine trees narrowing in perspective
before the eye. Some have been cut in two by
the direct hit of a heavy shell and others splintered
down, bit by bit. Others still standing have been hit
many times. There are cuts as fresh as if the chip
had just flown from the axeman’s blow, and there are
scars from cuts made last autumn which nature’s sap,
rising as it does in the veins of wounded men, has
healed while it sent forth leaves in answer to the call
of spring from the remaining branches.</p>

<p>In this neighbourhood the earth is many-mouthed
with caves and cut with passages running from cave
to cave, so that the inhabitants may go and come hidden
from sight. Jawbone and Hairyman and Lowbrow,
of the stone age, would be at home here, squatting
on their hunkers and tearing at their raw kill
with their long incisors. It does not seem a place for
men who walk erect, wear woven fabrics, enjoy a
written language, and use soap and safety razors.
One would not be surprised to see some figure swing
down by a long, hairy arm from a branch of a tree
and leap on all fours into one of the caves, where he
would receive a gibbering welcome to the bosom of his
family.</p>

<p>Not so! Huddled in these holes in the earth are
free-born men of an old civilisation, who read the
daily papers and eat jam on their bread. They do
not want to be there, but they would not consider
themselves worthy of the inheritance of free-born
men if they were not. Only civilised man is capable
of such stoicism as theirs. They have reverted to the
cave-dweller’s protection because their civilisation is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">326</a></span>
so highly developed that they can throw a piece of
steel weighing anywhere from eighteen to two thousand
pounds anywhere from five to twenty miles with
merciless accuracy, and because the flesh of man is
even more tender than in the cave-dweller’s time, not
to mention that his brain-case is a larger target.</p>

<p>An officer calls our attention to a shell-proof shelter
with the civic pride of a member of a Chamber of
Commerce pointing out the new Union Station.</p>

<p>“Not even a high explosive”&mdash;the kind that bursts
on impact after penetration&mdash;“could get into that!”
he says. “We make them for generals and colonels
and those who have precious heads on their shoulders.”</p>

<p>With material and labour, the same might have
been constructed for the soldiers; which brings us
back to the question of munitions in the economic balance
against a human life. It was the first shelter of
this kind which I had seen. One never goes up to the
trenches without seeing something new. The defensive
is tireless in its ingenuity in saving lives and the
offensive in taking them. Safeguards and salvage
compete with destruction. And what labour all that
excavation and construction represented&mdash;the cumulative
labour of months and day-by-day repairs of the
damage done by shells. After a bombardment, dig
out the filled trenches and renew the smashed dugouts
to be ready for another go!</p>

<p>The walls of that communication trench were two
feet above our heads. We noticed that all the men
were in their dugouts; none were walking about in the
open. One knew the meaning of this barometer&mdash;stormy.
The German gunners were “strafing quite
lively” this afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">327</a></span>
Already we had noticed many shells bursting five
or six hundred yards away, in the direction of the
new British trench; but at that distance they do not
count. Then a railroad train seemed to have jumped
the track and started to fly. Fortunately and unfortunately,
sound travels faster than big shells of low
velocity; fortunately, because it gives you time to be
undignified in taking cover; unfortunately, because it
gives you a fraction of a second to reflect whether
or not that shell has your name and your number on
Dugout Street. I was certain that it was a big shell,
of the kind that will blow a dugout to pieces. Any
one who had never heard a shell before would have
“scrooched,” as the small boys say, as instinctively as
you draw back when the through express tears past
the station. It is the kind of scream that makes you
want to roll yourself into a package about the size
of a pea, while you feel as tall and large as a cathedral,
judged by the sensation that travels down your
backbone.</p>

<p>Once I was being hoisted up a cliff in a basket, when
the rope on the creaking windlass above slipped a
few inches. Well, it is like that, or like taking a false
step on the edge of a precipice. Is the clock about
to strike twelve or not? Not this time! The burst
was thirty yards away, along the path we had just traversed,
and the sound of it was like the burst of a
shell and like nothing else in the world, just as the
swirling, boring, growing scream of a shell is like
no other scream in the world. A gigantic hammerhead
sweeps through the air and breaks a steel drumhead.</p>

<p>If we had come along half a minute later we should
have had a better view, and perhaps now we should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">328</a></span>
have been on a bed in a hospital worrying how we
were going to pay the rent, or in the place where,
hopefully, we have no worries at all. Between walls
of earth the report was deadened to our ears in the
same way as a revolver report in an adjoining room;
and not much earth had gone down the backs of our
necks from the concussion.</p>

<p>Looking over the parapet, we saw a cloud of thick,
black smoke; and we heard the outcry of a man who
had been hit. That was all. The shell might have
struck nearer without our having seen or heard any
more. Shut in by the gallery walls, one knows as
little of what happens in an adjoining cave as a clam
buried in the sand knows of what is happening to a
neighbour clam. A young soldier came half stumbling
into the nearest dugout. He was shaking his
head and batting his ears as if he had sand in them.
Evidently he was returning to his home cave from a
call on a neighbour which had brought him close to
the burst.</p>

<p>“That must have been about six- or seven-inch,” I
said to the officer, trying to be moderate and casual
in my estimate, which is the correct form on such occasions.
My actual impression was forty-inch.</p>

<p>“Nine inch, h.&nbsp;e.,” replied the expert. This was
gratifying. It was the first time that I had been that
near to a nine-inch shell explosion. Its “eat-’em-alive”
frightfulness was depressing. But the experience
was worth having. One wants all the experiences
there are&mdash;but only “close.” A delightful
word that word close, at the front!</p>

<p>But the Germans were generous that afternoon.
Another big scream seemed aimed at my own head.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">329</a></span>
L&mdash;&mdash; disagreed with me; he said that it was aimed at
his. We did not argue the matter to the point of a
personal quarrel, for it might have got both our heads.
It burst back of the trench about as far away as the
other shell. After all, a trench is a pretty narrow
ribbon, even on a gunner’s large scale map, to hit.
It is wonderful how, firing at such long ranges, he
is able to hit the trench at all.</p>

<p>This was all of the nine-inch style, for the time
being. We got some fours and fives in our neighbourhood,
as we walked along. Three bursting as near
together as the ticks of a clock, made almost no smoke
as they brought some tree-limbs down and tore away
a section of a trunk. Then the thunder storm moved
on to another part of the line. Only, unlike the
thunder storms of nature, this, which is man-made
and controlled as a fireman controls the nozzle of his
hose, may sweep back again and yet again over its
path. All depends upon the decision of a German
artillery officer, just as whether or not a flower bed
shall get another sprinkle depends upon the will of
the gardener.</p>

<p>We were glad to turn out of the support trench into
a communication trench leading toward the front
trench; into another gallery cut deep in the fields, with
scattered shell-pits on either side. Still more soldiers,
leaning against the walls or seated with their legs
stretched out across the bottom of the ditch; more
waiting soldiers, only strung out in a line and as used
to the passing of shells as people living along the
elevated railroad line to the passing of trains. They
did not look up at the screams boring the air any more
than one who lives under the trains looks up every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">330</a></span>
time that one passes. Theirs was the passivity of a
queue waiting in line before the entrance to a theatre
or a ball-ground.</p>

<p>A senator or a lawyer, used to coolness in debate,
or to presiding over great meetings, or to facing
crowds, who happened to visit the trenches could have
got reassurance from the faces of any one of these
private soldiers, who had been trained not to worry
about death till death came. Harrowing every one
of these screams, taken by itself. Instinctively, unnecessarily,
you dodged at those which were low&mdash;unnecessarily
because they were from British guns.
No danger from them unless there was a short fuse.
To the soldiers, the low screams brought the delight
of having blows struck from their side at the enemy,
whom they themselves could not strike from their reserve
position.</p>

<p>For we were under the curving sweep of both the
British and the German shells, as they passed in the
air on the way to their targets. It was like standing
between two railroad tracks with trains going by
in opposite directions. You came to differentiate between
the multitudinous screams. “Ours!” you exclaimed,
with the same delight as when you see that
your side has the ball. The spirit of battle contest
rose in you. There was an end of philosophy.
These soldiers in the trenches were your partisans.
Every British shell was working for them and for
you, giving blow for blow.</p>

<p>The score of the contest of battle is in men down;
in killed and wounded. For every man down on your
side you want two men down on the enemy’s. Sport
ceases. It is the fight between a burglar with a revolver
in his hand and a knife between his teeth; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">331</a></span>
a wounded man brought along the trench, a visible,
intimate proof of a hit by the enemy, calls for more
and harder blows.</p>

<p>Looking over the parapet of the communication
trench you saw fields, lifeless except for the singing
birds in the wheat, who had also the spirit of battle.
The more shells, the more they warble. It was always
so on summer days. Between the screams you
heard their full-pitched chorus, striving to make itself
heard in competition with the song of German
invasion and British resistance. Mostly, the birds
seemed to take cover like mankind; but I saw one
sweep up from the golden sea of ripening grain toward
the men-brothers with their wings of cloth.</p>

<p>Was this real, or was it extravaganza? Painted
airships and a painted summer sky? The audacity of
those British airmen! Two of them were spotting
the work of British guns by their shell-bursts and
watching for gun-flashes which would reveal concealed
German battery positions, and whispering results by
wireless to their own batteries.</p>

<p>It is a great game. Seven or eight thousand feet
high, directly over the British planes, is a single Taube
cruising for the same purpose. It looks like a beetle
with gossamer wings suspended from a light cloud.
The British aviators are so low that the bull’s-eye
identification marks are distinctly visible to the naked
eye. They are playing in and out, like the short stop
and second baseman around second, there in the very
arc of the passing shells from both sides fired at
other targets. But scores of other shells are most
decidedly meant for them. In the midst of a lace-work
of puffs of shrapnel bursts, which slowly spread
in the still air, from the German anti-aircraft guns,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">332</a></span>
they dip and rise and turn in skilful dodging. At
length, one retires for good; probably his planecloth
has become too much like a sieve from shrapnel fragments
to remain aloft longer.</p>

<p>Come down, Herr Taube, come down where we
can have a shot at you! Get in the game! You can
see better at the altitude of the British airmen! But
Herr Taube always stays high&mdash;the Br’er Fox of the
air. Of course, it was not so exciting as the pictures
that artists draw, but it was real.</p>

<p>Every kind of shell was being fired, low and high
velocity, small and large calibre. One-two-three-four
in quick succession as the roll of a drum, four German
shells burst in line up in the region where we
have made ourselves masters of the German trench.
British shells responded.</p>

<p>“Ours again!”</p>

<p>But I had already ducked before I spoke, as you
might if a pellet of steel weighing a couple of hundred
pounds, going at the rate of a thousand yards a
second or more, passed within a few yards of your
head&mdash;ducked to find myself looking into the face
of a soldier, who was smiling. The smile was not
scornful, but it was at least amused at the expense of
the sightseer, who had dodged one of our own shells.
In addition to the respirators in case of a possible
gas attack, supplied by that staff officer with a twinkle
in his eye, we needed a steel rod fastened to the back
of our necks and running down our spinal columns in
order to preserve our dignity.</p>

<p>We were witnessing what is called the “artillery
preparation for an infantry attack,” which was to try
to recover that two hundred yards of trench from the
British. Only the Germans did not limit their attention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">333</a></span>
to the lost trench alone. It was hottest there
around the bend of our line, from our view-point; for
there they must maul the trench into formless <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débris</i>
and cut the barbed wire in front of it before the
charge was made.</p>

<p>“They touch up all the trenches in the neighbourhood
to keep us guessing,” said the officer, “before
they make their final concentration. So it’s pretty
thick around this part.”</p>

<p>“Which might include the communication trench?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. This makes a good line shot. No
doubt they will spare us a few when they think it is
our turn. We do the same thing. So it goes.”</p>

<p>From the variety of screams of big shells and little
shells and screams harrowingly close and reassuringly
high, which were indicated as ours, one was warranted
in suggesting that the British were doing considerable
artillery preparation themselves.</p>

<p>“We must give them as good as they send&mdash;and
more.”</p>

<p>More seemed correct.</p>

<p>“Those close ones you hear are doubtless meant
for the front German trench, which accounts for their
low trajectory; the others for their support trenches
or any battery positions that our planes have located.”</p>

<p>We could not see where the British shells were
striking. We could judge only of the accuracy of
some of the German fire. Considering the storm
being visited on the support trench which we had
just left, we were more than ever glad to be out of
it. Artillery is the war burglar’s jimmy; but it has
to batter the house into ruins and smash all the plate
and blow up the safe and kill most of the family before
the burglar can enter. Clouds of dust rose from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">334</a></span>
the explosions; limbs of trees were lopped off by tornadoes
of steel hail.</p>

<p>“There! Look at that tree!”</p>

<p>In front of a portion of the British support trench
a few of a line of stately shade trees were still standing.
A German shell, about an eight-inch, one
judged, struck fairly in the trunk of one about the
same height from the ground as the lumberman sinks
his axe in the bark. The shimmer of hot gas spread
out from the point of explosion. Through it as
through an aureole one saw that twelve inches of
green wood had been cut in two as neatly as a thistle
stem is severed by a sharp blow from a walking-stick.
The body of the tree was carried across the splintered
stump with crushing impact from the power of
its flight, plus the power of the burst of the explosive
charge which broke the shell-jacket into slashing
fragments; and the towering column of limbs,
branches, and foliage laid its length on the ground
with a majestic dignity. Which shows what one shell
can do, one of three which burst in the neighbourhood
at the same time. In time, the shells would
get all the trees; make them into chips and splinters
and toothpicks.</p>

<p>“I’d rather that it would hit a tree-trunk than my
trunk,” said L&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>“But you would not have got it as badly as the
tree,” said the officer reassuringly. “The substance
would have been too soft for sufficient impact for a
burst. It would have gone right through!”</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>At battalion headquarters in the front trenches the
battalion surgeon had just amputated an arm which
had been mauled by a shell.</p>

<p>“Without any anæsthetic,” he explained. “No
chance if we sent him back to the hospital. He would
die on the way. Stood it very well. Already chirking
up.”</p>

<p>A family practitioner at home, the doctor, when the
war began, had left his practice to go with his Territorial
battalion. He retains the family practitioner’s
cheery, assuring manner. He is the kind of man
who makes you feel better immediately he comes into
the sick-room; who has already made you forget yourself
when he puts his finger on your pulse. There are
thousands of that kind at home. Probably you have
sent a hurry telephone call for his like more than
once.</p>

<p>“The same thing that we might have done in the
Crimea,” he continued, “only we have antiseptics<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">336</a></span>
now. It’s wonderful how little you can work with
and how excellent the results. Strong, healthy men,
these, with great recuperative power and discipline
and resolution&mdash;very different patients from those
we usually operate on.”</p>

<p>Tea was served inside the battalion commander’s
dugout. Tea is as essential every afternoon to the
British as ice to the average American in summer.
They don’t think of getting on without it if they can
possibly have it, and it is part of the rations. As
well take cigarettes away from those who smoke as
tea from the British soldier.</p>

<p>It was very much like tea outside the trenches, so
far as any signs of perturbation about shells and casualties
were concerned. In that the battalion commander
had to answer telegrams, it had the aspect
of a busy man’s sandwich at his desk for luncheon.
Good news to cheer the function had just come over
the network of wires which connects up the whole
army, from trenches to headquarters&mdash;good news in
the midst of the shells.</p>

<p>German West Africa had fallen. Botha, who was
fighting against the British fifteen years ago, had taken
it fighting for the British. A suggestive thought
that. It is British character that brings enemies like
Botha into the fold; the old, good-natured, sportsmanlike,
live-and-let-live idea, which has something to
do with keeping the United States intact. A board
with the news on it in German was put up over the
British trenches. Naturally, the board was shot full
of holes; for it is clear that the Germans are not yet
ready to come into the British Empire.</p>

<p>“Hans and Jacob we have named them,” said the
colonel, referring to two Germans who were buried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">337</a></span>
back of his dugout. “It’s dull up here when the
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boches</i> are not shelling, so we let our imaginations
play. We hold conversations with Hans and Jacob
in our long watches. Hans is fat and cheerful and
trusting. He believes everything that the Kaiser tells
him and has a cheerful disposition. But Jacob is a
professor and a fearful ‘strafer.’ It seems a little
gruesome, doesn’t it, but not after you have been in
the trenches for a while.”</p>

<p>A little gruesome&mdash;true! Not in the trenches&mdash;true,
too! Where all is satire, no incongruity seems
out of place. Life plays in and out with death; they
intermingle; they look each other in the face and say,
“I know you. We dwell together. Let us smile
when we may, at what we may, to hide the character
of our comradeship; for to-morrow&mdash;”</p>

<p>Only half an hour before one of the officers had
been shot through the head by a sniper. He was a
popular officer. The others had messed with him
and marched with him and known him in the fulness
of affection of comradeship in arms and dangers
shared. A heartbreak for some home in England.
No one dwelt on the incident. What was there to
say? The trembling lip, trembling in spite of itself,
was the only outward sign of the depth of feeling that
words could not reflect, at tea in the dugout. The
subject was changed to something about the living.
One must carry on cheerfully; one must be on the
alert; one must play his part serenely, unflinchingly,
for the sake of the nerves around him and for his
own sake. Such fortitude becomes automatic, it
would seem. Please, I must not hesitate about having
a slice of cake. They managed cake without any
difficulty up there in the trenches. And who if not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">338</a></span>
men in the trenches was entitled to cake, I should like
to know?</p>

<p>“It was here that he was hit,” another officer said,
as we moved on in the trench. “He was saying that
the sandbags were a little weak there and a bullet
might go through and catch a man, who thought himself
safely under cover as he walked along. He had
started to fix the sandbags himself when he got it.
The bullet came right through the top of one of the
bags in front of him.”</p>

<p>A bullet makes the merciful wound; and a bullet
through the head is a simple way of going. The bad
wounds come mostly from shells; but there is something
about seeing any one hit by a sniper which is
more horrible. It is a cold-blooded kind of killing,
more suggestive of murder, this single shot from a
sharpshooter waiting as patiently as a cat for a
mouse, aimed definitely to take the life of one man.</p>

<p>Again we move on in that narrow cut of earth with
its waiting soldiers, which the world knows so well
from reading tours of the trenches. No one not on
watch might show his head on an afternoon like this.
The men were prisoners between those walls of earth;
not even spectators of what the guns were doing;
simply moles. They took it all as a part of the day’s
work, with that singular, redoubtable combination of
British phlegm and cheerfulness.</p>

<p>Of course, some of them were eating bread and
marmalade and making tea. Where all the marmalade
goes which Mr. Atkins uses for his personal
munition in fighting the Germans puzzles the Army
Service Corps, whose business it is to see that he is
never without it. How could he sit so calmly under
shell-fire without marmalade? Never! He would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">339</a></span>
get fidgetty and forget his lesson, I am sure, like the
boy who had the button which he was used to fingering
removed before he went to recite.</p>

<p>Any minute a shell may come. Mr. Atkins does
not think of that. Time enough to think after it has
arrived. Then perhaps the burial party will be doing
your thinking for you; or if not, the doctors and the
nurses who look after you will.</p>

<p>I noted certain acts of fellowship of comrades who
are all in the same boat and have learned unselfishness.
When they got up to let you pass and you
smiled your thanks, you received a much pleasanter
smile in return than you will from many a well-fed
gentleman, who has to stand aside to let you enter
a restaurant. The manners of the trenches are good,
better than in many places where good manners are
a cult.</p>

<p>There is no better place to send a spoiled, undisciplined,
bumptious youth than to a British trench. He
would learn that there are other men in the world
besides himself and that a shell can kill a rich brute
or a selfish brute as readily as a poor man. Democracy
there is in the trenches; the democracy where
all men are in the presence of death and “hazing”
parties need not be organised among the students.</p>

<p>But there is another and a greater element in the
practical psychology of the trenches. These good-natured
men, fighting the bitterest kind of warfare,
without the signs of brutality which we associate with
the prize fighter and the bully in their faces, know
why they are fighting. They consider that their duty
is in that trench, and that they could not have a title
to manhood if they were not there. After the war
the men who have been in the trenches will rule England.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">340</a></span>
Their spirit and their thinking will fashion
the new trend of civilisation, and the men who have
not fought will bear the worst scars from the war.</p>

<p>Ridiculous it is that men should be moles, perhaps;
but at the same time there is something sublime
in the fellowship of their courage and purpose,
as they “sit and take it,” or guard against attacks,
without the passion of battle of the old days of excited
charges and quick results, and watch the toll pass
by from hour to hour. Borne by comrades pickaback
we saw the wounded carried along that passage too
narrow for a litter. A splash of blood, a white
bandage, a limp form!</p>

<p>For the second permissible&mdash;periscopes are tempting
targets&mdash;I looked through one over the top of
the parapet. Another film! A big British lyddite
shell went crashing into the German parapet. The
dust from sandbags and dugouts merged into an immense
cloud of ugly, black smoke. As the cloud
rose, one saw the figure of a German dart out of
sight; then nothing was visible but the gap which the
explosion has made. No wise German would show
himself there. British snipers were watching for him.
At least half a dozen, perhaps a score, of men had
been put out by this single “direct hit” of an h.&nbsp;e.
(high explosive). Yes, the British gunners were
shooting well, too. Other periscopic glimpses proved
it.</p>

<p>Through the periscope we learned also that the
two lines of sandbags of German and British trenches
were drawing nearer together. Another wounded
man was brought by.</p>

<p>“They’re bombing up ahead. He has just been
hit by a bomb.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">341</a></span>
As we drew aside to make room for him to pass,
once more the civilian realised his helplessness and
unimportance. One soldier was worth ten Prime
Ministers in that place. We were as conspicuously
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mal à propos</i> as an outsider at a bank directors’ meeting
or in a football scrimmage. The officer politely
reminded us of the necessity of elbow room in the narrow
quarters for the bombers, who were hidden from
view by the zigzag traverses, and I was not sorry,
though perhaps my companions were. If so, they
did not say so, not being talkative men. We were
not going to see that two hundred yards of captured
trench that was beyond the bombing action, after all.
Oh, the twinkle in that staff officer’s eye!</p>

<p>“A <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boche</i> gas shell!” we were told, as we passed
an informal excavation in the communication trench
on our way back. “Asphyxiating effect. No time
to put on respirators when one explodes. Laid out
half a dozen men like fish, gasping for air, but they
will recover.”</p>

<p>“The <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boches</i> want us to hurry!” exclaimed L&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>They were giving the communication trench a turn
at “strafing,” now, and shells were urgently dropping
behind us. There was no use of trying to respond to
one’s natural inclination to run away from the pursuing
shower when you had to squeeze past soldiers as
you went.</p>

<p>“But look at what we are going into! This is like
beating up grouse to the guns, and we are the birds!
I am wondering if I like it.”</p>

<p>We could tell what had happened in our absence in
the support trench by the litter of branches and leaves
and by the excavations made by shells. It was still
happening, too. Another nine-inch, with your only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">342</a></span>
view of your surroundings the wall of earth which
you hugged. Crash&mdash;and safe again!</p>

<p>“Pretty!” L&mdash;&mdash; said, smiling. He was referring
to the cloud of black smoke from the burst. Pretty
is a favourite word of his. I find that men use habitual
exclamations on such occasions. R&mdash;&mdash;, also smiling,
had said, “A black business, this!” a favourite
expression with him.</p>

<p>“Yet&mdash;pretty!” R&mdash;&mdash; and I exclaimed together.</p>

<p>L&mdash;&mdash; took a sliver off his coat and offered it to us
as a souvenir. He did not know that he had said
“Pretty!” or R&mdash;&mdash; that he had said “A black business!”
several times that afternoon; nor did I know
that I had exclaimed “For the love of Mike!” Psychologists
take notice; and golfers are reminded that
their favourite expletives when they foozle will come
perfectly natural to them when the Germans are
“strafing.” Then another nine-inch, when we were
out of the gallery in front of the warrens. My companions
happened to be near a dugout. They did not
go in tandem, but abreast. It was a “dead heat.”
All that I could see in the way of cover was a wall
of sandbags, which looked about as comforting as
tissue paper in such a crisis.</p>

<p>At least, one faintly realised what it meant to be
in the support trenches, where the men were still
huddled in their caves. They never get a shot at the
enemy or a chance to throw a bomb, unless they are
sent forward to assist the front trenches in resisting
an attack. It is for this purpose that they are kept
within easy reach of the front trenches. They are
like the prisoner tied to a chair-back, facing a gun.</p>

<p>“Yes, this was pretty heavy shell-fire,” said an
officer, who ought to know. “Not so bad as on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">343</a></span>
trenches which the infantry are to attack&mdash;that is
the first degree. You might call this the second.”</p>

<p>It was heavy enough to keep any writer from being
bored. The second degree will do. We will leave
the first till another time.</p>

<p>Later, when we were walking along a paved road,
I heard what seemed the siren call of another nine-inch.
Once, in another war, I had been on a paved
road when&mdash;well, I did not care to be on this one
if a nine-inch hit it and turned fragments of paving-stones
into projectiles. An effort to “run out the
bunt”&mdash;Cæsar’s ghost! It was one of our own
shells! Nerves! Shame! Two stretcher-bearers
with a wounded man looked up in surprise, wondering
what kind of a hide-and-seek game we were playing.
They made a picture of imperturbability of the
kind that is a cure for nerves under fire. If the other
fellow is not scared it does not do for you to be
scared.</p>

<p>“Did you get any shells in your neighbourhood?”
we asked the chauffeur&mdash;also British and imperturbable&mdash;whom
we found waiting at a clearing station
for wounded.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I saw several, but none hit the car.”</p>

<p>As we came to the first cross-roads in that dead
land back of the trenches which was still being shelled
by shrapnel, though not another car was in sight and
ours had no business there (as we were told afterward),
that chauffeur, as he slowed up before turning,
held out his hand from habit as he would have
done in Piccadilly.</p>

<p>Two or three days later things were normal along
the front again, with Mr. Atkins still stuffing himself
with marmalade in that two hundred yards of trench.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>The Western front: a pulsating, changing line&mdash;Offensive with the
British&mdash;The buoyant youth of England&mdash;Not a “good show”&mdash;English
sportsmanship&mdash;A successful battalion&mdash;Psychology
of the charge&mdash;“Here we are again!”&mdash;Stories of the capture&mdash;The
“Keetcheenaires”&mdash;An army in the making.</p></blockquote>

<p>Seeming an immovable black line set as a frontier in
peace, that Western front on your map which you
bought early in the war in anticipation of rearranging
the flags in keeping with each day’s news was, in reality,
a pulsating, changing line.</p>

<p>At times one thought of it as an enormous rope
under the constant pressure of soldiers on either side,
who now and then, with an “all together” of a tug
of war at a given point, straightened or made a bend,
with the result imperceptible except as you measured
it by a tree or a house. Battles as severe as the most
important in South Africa, battles severe enough to
have decided famous campaigns in Europe in older
days, when one king rode forth against another, became
the landmark incidents of the give and take, the
wrangling and the wrestling of siege operations.</p>

<p>The sensation of victory or defeat for those engaged
became none the less vivid because victory
meant the gain of so little ground and defeat the loss
of so little; perhaps the more vivid in want of the
movement of pursuing or of being pursued in the shock
of arms in past times when an army front hardly covered
that of one brigade in the trenches. For winners<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">345</a></span>
and losers returning to their billets in French villages,
as other battalions took their places, had time
to think over the action.</p>

<p>The offensive was mostly with the British through
the summer of 1915; any thrust by the Germans was
usually to retake a section of trenches which they had
lost. But our attacks did not all succeed, of course.
Battalions knew success and failure; and their narratives
were mine to share, just as one would share
the good luck or the bad luck of his neighbours.</p>

<p>You may have a story of heartbreak or triumph an
hour after you have been chatting with playing children
in a village street, as the car speeds toward the
zone where the reserves are billeted and the occasional
shell is warning that peace is behind you.
First, one alights near the headquarters of two battalions
which have been in an attack that failed. The
colonel of the one to the left of the road was killed.
We go across the fields to the right. Among the surviving
officers resting in their shelter tents, where
there is plenty of room now, is the adjutant, tall, boyish,
looking tired, but still with no outward display
of what he has gone through and what it has meant
to him. I have seen him by the hundreds, this buoyant
type of English youth. The colonel comes out
of the farmhouse and he sends for some other officers.</p>

<p>In army language, theirs had not been a “good
show.” We had heard the account of it with that
matter-of-fact prefix from G.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Q., where they took
results with the necessarily cold eye of logic. The
two battalions were set to take a trench; that was all.
In the midst of merciless shell-fire they had waited for
their own guns to draw all the teeth out of the trench.
When the given moment came they swept forward.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">346</a></span>
But our artillery had not “connected up” properly.</p>

<p>The German machine guns were not out of commission,
and for them it was like working a loom playing
the bullets back and forth across the zone of a
hundred yards which the British had to traverse. The
British had been told to charge and they charged.
Theirs not to reason why; that was the glory of the
thing. Nothing more gallant in warfare than their
persistence, till they found that it was like trying to
swim in a cataract of lead. One officer got within fifty
yards of the German parapet before he fell. At last
they realised that it could not be done&mdash;later than
they should, but they were a proud regiment and
though they had been too brave, there was something
splendid about it.</p>

<p>With a soldier’s winning frankness and simplicity
they told what had happened. Even before they
charged they knew the machine guns were in place;
they knew what they had to face. One spoke of seeing,
as they lay waiting, a German officer standing
up in the midst of the British shell-fire.</p>

<p>“A stout-hearted fighter! We had to admire
him!” said the adjutant.</p>

<p>It was a chivalrous thought with a deep appeal,
considering what he had been through. Oh, these
English! They will not hate; they cannot be separated
from their sense of sportsmanship.</p>

<p>It was not the first time the guns had not “connected
up” for either side, and German charges on
many occasions had met a like fate. Calm enough,
these officers, true to their birthright of phlegm. They
did not make excuses. Success is the criterion
of battle. They had failed. Their unblinking recognition
of the fact was a sort of self-punishment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">347</a></span>
which cut deep into your own sensitiveness. One
young lieutenant could not keep his lip from trembling
over that naked, grim thought. The pride of regiment
had been struck a whip-blow which meant more
to the soldier than any injury to his personal pride.</p>

<p>But next time! They wanted another try for that
trench, these survivors. No matter about anything
else&mdash;the battalion must have another chance. You
appreciated this from a few words and more from the
stubborn resolution in the bearing of all. There was
no “let-us-at-’em-again” frightfulness. In order to
end this war you must “lick” one side or the other,
and these men were not “licked.” One was sorry
that he had gone to see them. It was like lacerating
a wound. One could only assure them, in his faith
in their gallantry, that they would win next time.
And oh, how you wanted them to win! They deserved
to win because they were such manly losers.</p>

<p>At home in their rough wooden houses in camp
we found a battalion which had won&mdash;the same undemonstrative
type as the one that had lost; the same
simplicity and kindly hospitality which gives life at
the front a charm in the midst of its tragedy, from
these men of one of the dependable line regiments.
This colonel knew the other colonel, and he said about
the other what his fellow-officers had said: it was not
his fault; he was a good man. If the guns were not
“on,” what happened to him was bound to happen to
anybody. They had been “on” for the winning battalion;
perfectly “on.” They had buried the machine
guns and the Germans with them.</p>

<p>When a man goes into the kind of charge that
either battalion made he gives himself up for lost.
The psychology is simple. You are going to keep on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">348</a></span>
until&mdash;! Well, as Mr. Atkins has remarked in his
own terse way, a battle was a lot of noise all around
you and suddenly a big bang in your ear; and then
somebody said, “Please open your mouth and take
this!” and you found yourself in a white, silent place
full of cots.</p>

<p>The winning battalion was amazed how easily the
thing was done. They had “walked in.” They
were a little surprised to be alive&mdash;thanks to the
guns. “Here we are! Here we are again!” as the
song at the front goes. It is all a lottery. Make
up your mind to draw the death number; and if you
don’t, that is velvet. Army courage these days is
highly sensitised steel in response to will.</p>

<p>They had won; there was a credit mark in the
regimental record. All had won; nobody in particular,
but the battalion, the lot of them. They did not
boast about it. The thing just happened. They
were alive and enjoying the sheer fact of life, writing
letters home, re-reading letters from home, looking
at the pictures in the illustrated papers, as they
leaned back and smoked their briar-wood pipes and
discussed politics with that freedom and directness of
opinion which is an Englishman’s pastime and his
birthright.</p>

<p>The captain who was describing the fight had retired
from the army, gone into business, and returned
as a reserve officer. The guns were to stop firing at
a given moment. As the minute-hand lay over the
figure on his wrist watch he dashed for the broken
parapet, still in the haze of dust from the shell-bursts,
to find not a German in sight. All were under cover.
He enacted the ridiculous scene with humorous appreciation
of how he came face to face with a German<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">349</a></span>
as he turned a traverse. He was ready with his revolver
and the other was not, and the other was his
prisoner.</p>

<p>There was nothing grewsome about listening to a
diffident soldier explaining how he “bombed them
out,” and you shared his amusement over the surprise
of a German who stuck his head out of a dugout
within a foot of the face of a British soldier, who was
peeping inside to see if any more <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boches</i> were at
home. You rejoiced with this battalion. Victory is
sweet.</p>

<p>When on the way back to quarters you passed some
of the New Army men, “the Keetcheenaires,” as the
French call them, you were reminded of how, although
the war was old, the British army was young.
There was a “Watch our city grow!” atmosphere
about it. Little by little, some great force seems
steadily pushing up from the rear. It made that business
institution at G.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Q. feel like bankers with an
enormous, increasing surplus. In this the British is
like no other army. One has watched it in the
making.</p></div>

<span class="subhead">THE MAPLE LEAF FOLK</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>These were home folks to the American. You
might know all by their maple leaf symbol; but even
before you saw that, with its bronze none too prominent
against the khaki, you knew those who were not
recent emigrants from England to Canada by their
accent and by certain slang phrases which pay no customs
duty at the border.</p>

<p>When, on a dark February night cruising in a
slough of a road, I heard out of a wall of blackness
back of the trenches, “Gee! Get onto the bus!”
which referred to our car, and also, “Cut out the
noise!” I was certain that I might dispense with an
interpreter. After I had remarked that I came from
New York, which is only across the street from Montreal
as distances go in our countries, the American
batting about the front at midnight was welcomed
with a “glad hand” across that imaginary line which
has and ever shall have no fortresses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">351</a></span>
What a strange place to find Canadians&mdash;at the
front in Europe! I could never quite accommodate
myself to the wonder of a man from Winnipeg, and
perhaps a “neutral” from Wyoming in his company,
fighting Germans in Flanders. A man used to a
downy couch and an easy-chair by the fire and steam-heated
rooms, who had ten thousand a year in
Toronto, when you found him in a chill, damp cellar
of a peasant’s cottage in range of the enemy’s shells
was getting something more novel, if not more picturesque,
than dog-mushing and prospecting on the
Yukon; for that contrast we are quite used to.</p>

<p>All I asked of the Canadians was to allow a little
of the glory they had won&mdash;they had won such a
lot&mdash;to rub off on their neighbours. If there must
be war, and no Canadian believed in it as an institution,
why, to my mind, the Canadians did a fine thing
for civilisation’s sake. It hurt sometimes to think
that we also could not be in the fight for the good
cause, too, particularly after the <i>Lusitania</i> was sunk,
when my own feelings had lost all semblance to neutrality.</p>

<p>The Canadians enlivened life at the front; for they
have a little more zip to them than the thoroughgoing
British. Their climate spells “hustle,” and we
are all the product of climate to a large degree,
whether in England, on the Mississippi flatlands, or
in Manitoba. Eager and highstrung the Canadian
born, quick to see and act. Very restless they were
when held up on Salisbury Plain, after they had come
three-four-five-six thousand miles to fight and there
was nothing but mud in an English winter to fight.</p>

<p>One from the American continent knew what ailed
them; they wanted action. They may have seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">352</a></span>
undisciplined to a drill sergeant; but the kind of discipline
they needed was a sight of the real thing.
They wanted to know, What for? And Lord Kitchener
was kinder to them, though many were beginners,
than to his own new army; he could be, as they
had their guns and equipment ready. So he sent
them over to France before it was too late in the
spring to get frozen feet from standing in icy water
looking over a parapet at a German parapet. They
liked Flanders mud better than Salisbury Plain mud,
because it meant that there was “something doing.”</p>

<p>It was in their first trenches that I first saw them,
and they were “on the job, all right,” in face of scattered
shell-fire and the sweep of the searchlights and
the flares. They had become the most ardent of
pupils, for here was that real thing which steadied
them and proved their metal. They refashioned
their trenches and drained them with the fastidiousness
of good housekeepers, who had a frontiersman’s
experience for an inheritance. In a week they appeared
to be old hands at the business.</p>

<p>“Their discipline is different from ours,” said a
British general, “but it works out. They are splendid.
I ask for no better troops.”</p>

<p>They may have lacked the etiquette of discipline
of British regulars, but they had the natural discipline
of self-reliance and of “go to it” when a crisis
came. This trench was only an introduction, a preparation
for a thing which was about as real as ever
fell to the lot of any soldiers. It is not for me to
tell here the story of their part in the second battle
of Ypres when the gas fumes rolled in upon them. I
should like to tell it and also the story of the deeds
of many British regiments, from the time of Mons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">353</a></span>
to Festubert. All Canada knows it in detail from
their own correspondents and their record officer.
England will one day know about her regiments; her
stubborn regiments of the line, her county regiments,
who have won the admiration of all the crack regiments,
whether English or Scots.</p>

<p>“When that gas came along,” said one Canadian,
who expressed the Canadian spirit, “we knew the
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Boches</i> were springing a new one on us. You know
how it is if a man is hit in the face by a cloud of
smoke when he is going into a burning building to
get somebody out. He draws back&mdash;and then he
goes in. We went in. We charged&mdash;well, it was
the way we felt about it. We wanted to get at them
and we were boiling mad over such a dastardly kind of
attack.”</p>

<p>Higher authorities than any civilian have testified
to how that charge helped, if it did not save the situation.
And then at Givenchy&mdash;straight work into the
enemy’s trenches under the guns. Canada is a part
of the British Empire and a precious part; but the
Canadians, all imperial politics aside, fought their
way into the affections of the British army, if they
did not already possess it. They made the Rocky
Mountains seem more majestic and the Thousand Islands
more lovely.</p>

<p>If there are some people in the United States busy
with their own affairs who look on the Canadians as
living up north somewhere toward the Arctic Circle
and not very numerous, that old criterion of merit
which discovers in the glare of battle’s publicity merit
which already existed has given to the name Canadian
a glory which can be appreciated only with the perspective
of time. The Civil War left us a martial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">354</a></span>
tradition; they have won theirs. Some day a few of
their neutral neighbours, who fought by their side will
be joining in their army reunions and remarking,
“Wasn’t that mud in Flanders&mdash;” etc.</p>

<p>My thanks to the Canadians for being at the front.
They brought me back to the plains and the Northwest,
and they showed the Germans on some occasions
what a blizzard is like when expressed in bullets
instead of in snowflakes, by men who know how to
shoot. I had continental pride in them. They had
the dry, pungent philosophy and the indomitable optimism
which the air of the plains and the St. Lawrence
Valley seems to develop. They were not afraid to
be a little emotional and sentimental. There is room
for that sort of thing between Vancouver and Halifax.
They had been in some “tough scraps” which
they saw clear-eyed, as they would see a boxing-match
or a spill from a canoe into a Canadian rapids.</p>

<p>As for the Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry,
all old soldiers of the South African campaign
almost without exception, knowing and hardened,
their veteran experience gave them an earlier opportunity
in the trenches than the first Canadian division.
Brigaded with British regulars, the Princess Pats
were a sort of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps d’élite</i>. Colonel Francis Farquhar,
known as “Fanny,” was their colonel, and he
knew his men. After he was killed his spirit remained
with them. Asked if they could stick, they
said, “Yes, sir!” cheerily, as he would have wanted
them to say it.</p>

<p>I am going to tell you about the work of the Princess
Pats on May 8th, not to single them out from
any other regiment, but because it is typical of the
kind of fighting which many another regiment has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">355</a></span>
known and I have it in illustrative detail. Losses,
day by day losses, characteristic of trench warfare,
they had previously suffered in holding a difficult
salient at St. Eloi&mdash;losses that added up into the
hundreds. Heretofore as one of them said, they had
been holding down the lid of hell, but on May 8th
they were to hold on to the edge of the opening by
the skin of their teeth and look down into the bowels
of hell after the Germans had blown off the lid with
high explosives.</p>

<p>It was in a big château that I first heard the story
and felt the thrill of it told by the tongues of its participants.
There were twenty bedrooms in that château.
If I wished to stay all night I might occupy
three or four&mdash;and as for that bathroom, paradise
to men who have been buried in filthy mud by high
explosives, the Frenchman who planned it had the
most spacious ideas in immersions. A tub or a
shower or a hose as you pleased. Some bathroom,
that!</p>

<p>For nothing in the British army was too good for
the Princess Pats before May 8th; and since May 8th
nothing was quite good enough. Five of us sat down
to dinner in a banquet hall looking out on a private
park, big enough to hold fifty. The talk ran fast.</p>

<p>“Too bad Gault is not here. He’s in England
recovering from his wound. Gault is six feet tall and
five feet of him legs. All day in that trench with a
shell wound in his thigh and arm. God! How he
was suffering! But not a moan&mdash;his face twitching
and trying to make the twitch into a smile&mdash;and
telling us to stick.”</p>

<p>“Buller away, too. He was the second in command.
Gault succeeded him. Buller was hit on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">356</a></span>
May 5th&mdash;and missed the big show&mdash;piece of shell
in the eye.”</p>

<p>“And Charlie Stewart, who was shot through the
stomach. How we miss him. If ever there were a
‘live-wire’ it’s Charlie. Up or down, he’s smiling
and ready for the next adventure. Once he made
thirty thousand dollars in the Yukon&mdash;and spent it
on the way to Vancouver. The first job he could get
was washing dishes&mdash;but he wasn’t washing them
long. Again he started out in the Northwest on an
expedition with four hundred traps to cut into the
fur business of the Hudson’s Bay Company. His
Indians got sick; he wouldn’t desert them&mdash;and before
he was through he had a time which beat anything
yet opened up for us by the Germans in Flanders&mdash;but
you have heard such stories from the
Northwest before. Being shot through the stomach
the way he was all the doctors agreed that Charlie
would die. It was like Charlie to disagree with
them. He always has his own point of view. So
he is getting well. Charlie came out to the war with
the packing-case which had been used by his grandfather,
who was an officer in the Crimean War. He
said that it would bring him luck.”</p>

<p>The 4th of May was bad enough&mdash;a ghastly forerunner
for the 8th. On the 4th the P.&nbsp;P’s, after
having been under shell-fire throughout the second
battle of Ypres&mdash;the “gas battle”&mdash;were ordered
forward to a new line to the southeast of Ypres. To
the north of Ypres the British line had been driven
back by the concentration of shell-fire and the rolling,
deadly march of the clouds of asphyxiating gas.</p>

<p>The Germans were still determined to take the
town which they had showered with four million dollars’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">357</a></span>
worth of shells. It would be big news&mdash;the
fall of Ypres as a prelude to the fall of Przemysl
and of Lemberg. A wicked salient was produced in
the British line to the southeast by the cave-in to the
north. It seems to be the lot of the P.&nbsp;P’s to get
into salients. On the 4th they lost 28 men killed
and 98 wounded from a gruelling all-day shell-fire
and stone-walling. That night they got relief and
were out for two days, when they were back in the
front trenches again. The 5th and the 6th were
fairly quiet; that is, what the P.&nbsp;P’s or Mr. Thomas
Atkins would call quiet. Average mortals wouldn’t.
They would try to appear unconcerned and say they
had been under pretty heavy fire&mdash;which means
shells all over the place and machine guns combing
the parapet. Very dull, indeed. Only three men
killed and seventeen wounded.</p>

<p>On the night of May 7th the P.&nbsp;P’s had a muster
of 635 men. This was a good deal less than half
of the original total in the battalion, including recruits
who had come out to fill the gaps caused by
death, wounds and sickness. Bear in mind that before
this war a force was supposed to prepare for
retreat with a loss of ten per cent. and get under way
to the rear with the loss of fifteen per cent., and that
with the loss of thirty per cent. it was supposed to
have borne all that can be expected of the best trained
soldiers.</p>

<p>The Germans were quiet that night&mdash;suggestively
quiet. At 4.30 the prelude began; by 5.30 the German
gunners had fairly warmed to their work. They
were using every kind of shell they had in the locker.
Every signal wire the P.&nbsp;P’s possessed had been cut.
The brigade commander could not know what was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">358</a></span>
happening to them and they could not know his
wishes&mdash;except that it may be taken for granted that
the orders of any British brigade commander are always
to “stick it.”</p>

<p>The shell-fire was as thick at the P.&nbsp;P.’s backs as
in front of them. They were fenced in by shell-fire.
And they were infantry taking what the guns gave
in order to put them out of business so that the way
would be clear for the German infantry to charge.
In theory they ought to have been buried and mangled
beyond the power of resistance by what is called
“the artillery preparation for the infantry in attack.”</p>

<p>Every man of the P.&nbsp;P’s knew what was coming.
There was relief in their hearts when they saw the
Germans break from their trenches and start down
the slope of the hill in front. Now they could take
it out of the German infantry in payment for what
the German guns were doing to them. This was their
only thought. Being good shots, with the instinct of
the man who is used to shooting at game, the P.&nbsp;P’s
“shoot to kill” and at individual targets. The light
green of the German uniform is more visible on the
deep green background of spring grass and foliage
than against the tints of autumn.</p>

<p>At two or three or four hundred yards no one of
the marksmen of the P.&nbsp;P’s, and there were several
said to be able to “shoot the eye off an ant,” could
miss the target. As for Corporal Christy, the old
bear hunter of the Northwest, he leaned out over the
parapet when a charge began because he could shoot
better in that position. They kept on knocking down
Germans; they didn’t know that men around them
were being hit; they hardly knew that they were being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">359</a></span>
shelled except when a burst shook their aim or filled
their eyes with dust. In that case they wiped the
dust out of their eyes and went on. The first that
many of them realised that the German attack was
broken was when they saw green blots in front of the
standing figures&mdash;which were now going in the other
direction. Then the thing was to keep as many of
these as possible from getting back over the hill.
After that they could dress the wounded and make
the dying a little more comfortable. For there was
no getting the wounded to the rear. They had to
remain there in the trench perhaps to be wounded
again, spectators of their comrades’ valour without
the preoccupation of action.</p>

<p>In the official war journal where a battalion keeps
its records&mdash;that precious historical document which
will be safeguarded in fireproof vaults one of these
days&mdash;you may read in cold official language what
happened in one section of the British line on the 8th
of May. Thus:</p>

<p>“7 <span class="smcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> Fire trench on right blown in at several
points.... 9 <span class="smcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> Lieutenants Martin and
Triggs were hit and came out of left communicating
trench with number of wounded.... Captain Still
and Lieut. de Bay hit also.... 9.30 <span class="smcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span> All
machine guns were buried (by high explosive shells)
but two were dug out and mounted again. A shell
killed every man in one section.... 10.30 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>
Lieut. Edwards was killed.... Lieutenant Crawford,
who was most gallant, was severely wounded....
Captain Adamson, who had been handing out
ammunition, was hit in the shoulder, but continued
to work with only one arm useful.... Sergeant-Major
Frazer, who was also handing out ammunition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">360</a></span>
to support trenches, was killed instantly by a bullet
in the head.”</p>

<p>At 10.30 only four officers remained fit for action.
All were lieutenants. The ranking one of these was
Niven, in command after Gault was wounded at 7 <span class="smcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>
We have all met the Niven type anywhere from the
Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Circle, the high-strung,
wiry type, who moves about too fast to carry any loose
flesh and accumulates none because he does move
about so fast. A little man Niven, a rancher, a horseman,
with a good education and a knowledge of men.
He rather fits the old saying about licking his weight
in wild cats&mdash;wild cats being nearer his size than
lions or tigers.</p>

<p>Eight months before he had not known any more
about war than thousands of other Canadians of his
type, except that soldiers carried rifles over their
shoulders and kept step. But he had “Fanny” Farquhar
of the British army for his teacher; and he
studied the book of war in the midst of shells and
bullets&mdash;which means that the lessons stick in the
same way as the lesson the small boy receives when
he touches the red-hot end of a poker to see how it
feels.</p>

<p>Writing in the midst of ruined trenches rocked by
the concussion of shells, every message he sent that
day, every report he made by orderly after the wires
were down was written out very explicitly&mdash;which
Farquhar had taught him was the army way. The
record is there of his coolness when the lid was blown
off of hell. For all you can tell by the firm chirography
he might have been sending a note to a ranch
foreman.</p>

<p>After his communications were cut, he was not certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">361</a></span>
how much support he had on his flanks. It
looked for a time as if he had none. After the first
charge was repulsed he made contact with the King’s
Royal Rifle Corps on his right. He knew from the
nature of the first German charge that the second
would be worse than the first. The Germans had advanced
some machine guns; they would be able to
place their increased artillery fire more accurately.
Again green figures started down that hill and again
they were put back. Then Niven was able to establish
contact with the Shropshire Light Infantry, another
regiment on his left. So he knew that right
and left he was supported&mdash;and by seasoned British
regulars. This was very, very comforting&mdash;especially
so when German machine gun fire was not only
coming from the front but in enfilade&mdash;which is so
trying to a soldier’s steadiness. In other words, the
P.&nbsp;P’s were shooting at Germans in front while bullets
were whipping crosswise of their trenches and
of the regulars on their flanks, too. Some of the
German infantrymen who had not been hit or had
not fallen back had dug themselves cover and were
firing at a closer range.</p>

<p>The Germans had located the points in the P.&nbsp;P’s’
trench occupied by the machine guns. At least, they
could put these hornets’ nests out of business, if not all
the individual riflemen. So they concentrated high
explosive shells on them. That did the trick; it buried
them. But a buried machine gun may be dug out
and fired again. It may be dug out two or three times
and keep on firing as long as it will work and there is
any one to man it.</p>

<p>While the machine guns were being exhumed every
man in one sector of the trench was killed. Then the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">362</a></span>
left half of the right fire trench got three or four
shells one after another bang into it. There was no
trench left: only macerated earth and mangled men.
Those emerging alive were told to fall back to the
communicating trench. Next the right end of the
left fire trench was blown in. When the survivors
fell back to the communication trench that was also
blown in their face.</p>

<p>“Oh, but we were having a merry party,” as Lieutenant
Vandenberg said.</p>

<p>Niven and his lieutenants were moving here and
there to the point of each new explosion to ascertain
the amount of the damage and to decide what was
to be done as the result. One soldier described
Niven’s eyes as sparks emitted from two holes in his
dust-caked face.</p>

<p>Papineau tells how a tree outside the trench was
cut in two by a shell and its trunk laid across the
breach of the trench caused by another shell; and
lying over the trunk limp and lifeless where he had
fallen was a man killed by still another shell.</p>

<p>“I remember how he looked because I had to step
around him and over the trunk,” said Papineau.</p>

<p>Unless you did have to step around a dead or
wounded man there was no time to observe his appearance;
for by noon there were as many dead and
wounded in the P.&nbsp;P’s’ trench as there were men fit
for action.</p>

<p>Those unhurt did not have to be steadied by their
superiors. Knocked down by a concussion they
sprang up with the promptness of disgust of one
thrown off a horse or tripped by a wire. When told
to move from one part of the trench to another where
there was desperate need, a word was sufficient direction.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">363</a></span>
They understood what was wanted of them,
these veterans. They went. They seized every lull
to drop the rifle for the spade and repair the breaches.
When they were not shooting they were digging.
The officers had only to keep reminding them not to
expose themselves in the breaches. For in the thick
of it&mdash;and the thicker the more so&mdash;they must try
to keep some dirt between all of their bodies except
the head and arm which must be up in order to fire.</p>

<p>At 1.30 a cheer rose from that trench. It was for
a platoon of the King’s Royal Rifles which had come
as reinforcement. Oh, but that band of Tommies did
look good to the P.&nbsp;P’s! And the little prize package
that the very reliable Mr. Atkins had with him&mdash;the
machine gun! You can always count on Mr. Atkins
to remain “among those present” to the last on
such occasions.</p>

<p>Now Niven got word by messenger to go to the
nearest point where the telephone was working and
tell the brigade commander the complete details of
the situation. The brigade commander asked him if
he could stick, and he said “Yes, sir!” which is what
Col. “Fanny” Farquhar would have said. That
trip was hardly what could be called peaceful. The
orderly whom Niven had with him both going and
coming was hit by high explosive shells. Niven is so
small&mdash;it is very difficult to hit him. He is about up
to Major Gault’s shoulder.</p>

<p>He had been worrying about his supply of rifle cartridges.
There were not enough to take care of another
German infantry charge which was surely coming.
After repelling two charges, think of failing to
repel the third for want of ammunition! Think of
Corporal Christy, the bear-hunter, with the Germans<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">364</a></span>
thick in front of him and no bullets for his rifle!
But appeared again Mr. Thomas Atkins&mdash;another
platoon of him with twenty boxes of cartridges which
were rather a risky burden to bring through the shell
fire. The relief as these were distributed was that of
having something at your throat which threatens to
strangle you removed.</p>

<p>Making another tour of his trenches about four in
the afternoon, Niven found that there was a gap of
fifty yards between his left and the right of the adjoining
regiment. Fifty yards is the inch on the end
of a man’s nose in trench warfare on such an occasion.
He was able to place eight men in that gap. At least,
they could keep a lookout and tell him what was going
on.</p>

<p>It was not cheering news either to learn a little
later that the regiments on his left had withdrawn to
trenches about three hundred yards to the rear&mdash;a
long distance in trench warfare. But the P.&nbsp;P’s had
no time for retirement. They could have gone only
in the panic of men who think of nothing in their demoralisation
except to flee from the danger in front
without thinking that there may be more danger to the
rear. They were held where they were under what
cover they had by the renewed blasts of shells&mdash;putting
the machine guns out of action again&mdash;which
suddenly ceased; for the Germans were coming on
again.</p>

<p>Now was the supreme effort. It was as a nightmare
in which only the objective of effort is recalled
and all else is a vague struggle of all the strength one
can exert against smothering odds. No use to ask
these men what they thought. What do you think
when you are climbing up a rope whose strands are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">365</a></span>
breaking over the edge of a precipice? You climb&mdash;that
is all.</p>

<p>The P.&nbsp;P’s shot at Germans. After a night without
sleep, after a day among their dead and wounded,
after the torrents of shell-fire, after breathing smoke,
dust and gas, these veterans were in a state of exaltation
entirely unconscious of dangers of their surroundings,
mindless of what came next, automatically shooting
to kill as they were trained to do, even as a man
pulls with every ounce of strength he has in him in a
close finish of a boat race.</p>

<p>Corporal Dover had to give up firing his machine
gun at last. Wounded, he had dug it out of the earth
after an explosion and set it up again. The explosion
that destroyed the gun finally crushed his leg and arm.
He crawled out of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débris</i> towards the support
trench which had become the fire trench, only to be
killed by a bullet.</p>

<p>The Germans got possession of a section of the P.
P’s’ trench where, it is believed, no Canadians were
left. But the German effort died there. It could get
no farther. This was as near to Ypres as the Germans
were to go in this direction. When the day’s
work was done and there in sight of the field scattered
with German dead, the P.&nbsp;P’s counted their numbers.
Of the 635 men who had begun the fight at daybreak
one hundred and fifty men and four officers, Niven,
Papineau, Clark and Vandenberg, remained fit for
duty.</p>

<p>Papineau is a young lawyer of Montreal, who had
already won the Military Cross for bombing Germans
out of a sap at St. Eloi. Vandenberg is a Dutchman&mdash;but
mostly he is Vandenberg. To him the call of
youth is the call to arms. He knows the roads of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">366</a></span>
Europe and the roads of Chihuahua. He was at
home fighting with Villa at Zacatecas and at home
fighting with the P.&nbsp;P’s in front of Ypres.</p>

<p>Darkness found all the survivors among the P.&nbsp;P’s
in the support and communication trenches. The fire
trench had become an untenable dust-heap. They
crept out only to bring in any wounded unable to help
themselves; and wounded and rescuers were more than
once hit in the process. It was too dangerous to attempt
to bury the dead, who were in the fire trench.
Most of them had already been buried by shells. For
them and for the dead in the support trenches interred
by their living comrades Niven recited such portions as
he could recall of the Church of England service for
the dead&mdash;recited them with a tight throat. Then
the P.&nbsp;P’s, unbeaten, marched out, leaving the position
to their relief, a battalion of the King’s Royal Rifle
Corps.</p>

<p>Eighteen hundred strong they had come out to
France; and after they had repulsed German charges
in the midst of shells that mauled their trenches at
Hooge on that indescribable day of May 8th, one
hundred and fifty were able to bear arms and little
Lieutenant Niven, polo player and horseman, who
had entered as a private, was in command. Corporal
Christy, bear-hunter of the Northwest, who could
“shoot the eyes off an ant,” by some miracle had escaped
without a scratch. All the praise that the
P.&nbsp;P’s, millionaire or labourer, scapegrace or respectable
pillar of society, ask is that they were worthy of
fighting side by side with Mr. Thomas Atkins, regular.
At best one poor little finite mind only observes
through a rift in the black smoke and yellow smoke of
high explosives and the clouds of dust and military<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">367</a></span>
secrecy something of what has happened in a small
section of that long line from Switzerland to the North
Sea many times; and this is given here.</p>

<p>Leaning against the wall in a corner of the dining-room
of the French château were the P.&nbsp;P’s’ colours.
Major Niven took off the wrapper in order that I
might see the flag with the initials of the battalion
which Princess Patricia embroidered with her own
hands. There’s room, one repeats, for a little sentiment
and a little emotion, too, between Halifax and
Vancouver.</p>

<p>“Of course we could not take our colours into
action,” said Niven. “They would have been torn
into tatters or buried in a shell crater. But we’ve always
kept them up at battalion headquarters. I believe
we are the only battalion that has. We promised
the Princess that we would.”</p>

<p>In her honour an old custom has been renewed in
France: knights are fighting in the name of a fair
lady.</p></div>

<span class="subhead">FINDING THE BRITISH FLEET</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The Briton’s island instinct&mdash;Secrecy surrounding the fleet&mdash;The
magic message&mdash;The journey&mdash;A night drive along the bleak
coast of Scotland&mdash;Boy scouts as sentries&mdash;An obdurate guard&mdash;The
navy yard&mdash;The Admiral’s “quarter deck”&mdash;The
largest contract in all England&mdash;Great dry docks&mdash;Patriots in
workmen’s clothes.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Briton’s national self-consciousness is surrounded
by salt water. His island instinct is only another
word for sea instinct. Ebb and flow of war on the
Continent, play of party politics at home, optimism
and pessimism wrestling in the press&mdash;in the back of
his head he was thinking of the navy.</p>

<p>During the first year of the war all other curtains
of military secrecy were parted at intervals; but the
world of British naval operations seemed hermetically
sealed. One could only imagine what the Grand Fleet
was like. He had despaired of ever seeing it in the
life, when good fortune slipped a message across the
Channel to the British front, which became the magic
carpet of transition from the burrowing army in its
trenches to the solid decks of battleships; which
changed the war correspondent’s modern steed, the
automobile, trailing dust over French roads, to destroyers
trailing foam in choppy seas off English
coasts.</p>

<p>But not all the journeying was on destroyers. One
must travel by car also if he would know something
of the intricate, busy world of the Admiralty’s work,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">369</a></span>
which makes coastguards a part of its personnel.
There was more than ships to see; more than one place
to go in that wonderful week.</p>

<p>The transition is less sudden if we begin with the
career of an open car along the coast of Scotland in
the night. Dusk had fallen on the purple cloud-lands
of heather dotted with the white spots of grazing
sheep in the Scotch highlands under changing skies,
with headlands stretching out into the misty reaches
of the North Sea, forbidding in the chill air after the
warmth of France and suggestive of the uninviting
theatre where, in approaching winter, patrols and
trawlers and mine-sweepers carried on their work to
within range of the guns of Heligoland. A people
who lived in such a chill land, in sight of such a chill
sea, and who spoke of their “bonnie Scotland forever,”
were worthy to be masters of that sea.</p>

<p>The Americans who think of Britain as a small island
forget the distance from Land’s End to John o’
Groat’s, which represents coast line to be guarded;
and we may find a lesson, too, we who must make our
real defence by sea, of tireless vigils which may be our
own if the old Armageddon beast ever comes threatening
the far-longer coast line that we have to defend.
For you may never know what war is till war comes.
Not even the Germans knew, though they had practised
with a lifelike dummy behind the curtains for
forty years.</p>

<p>At intervals, just as in the military zone in France,
sentries stopped us and took the number of our car;
but this time sentries, who were guarding a navy’s
rather than an army’s secrets. With darkness we
passed the light of an occasional inn, while cottage
lights made a scattered sprinkling among the dim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370">370</a></span>
masses of the hills. One wondered where all the
kilted Highland soldiers whom he had seen at the
front came from, without, I trust, disclosing any military
secret that the canny Highlanders enlist Lowlanders
in kilty regiments.</p>

<p>The Frenchmen of our party&mdash;M. Stephen Pichon,
former Foreign Minister, M. Réné Bazin, of the
Academie Française, M. Joseph Reinach, of the
<cite>Figaro</cite>, M. Pierre Mille, of <cite>Le Temps</cite>, and M. Henri
Ponsot&mdash;who had never been in Scotland before,
were on the lookout for a civilian Scot in kilts and
were grievously disappointed not to find a single one.</p>

<p>That night ride convinced me that however many
Germans might be moving about in England under the
guise of cockney or of Lancashire dialects in quest of
information, none has any chance in Scotland. He
could never get the burr, I am sure, unless born in
Scotland; and if he were, once he had it the triumph
ought to make him a Scotchman at heart.</p>

<p>The officer of the Royal Navy, who was in the car
with me, confessed to less faith in his symbol of
authority than in the generations’-bred burr of our
chauffeur to carry conviction of our genuineness; so
arguments were left to him and successfully, including
two or three with Scotch cattle, which seemed to be
co-operating with the sentries to block the road.</p>

<p>After an hour’s run inland and the car rose over a
ridge and descended on a sharp grade, in the distance
under the moonlight we saw the floor of the sea again,
melting into opaqueness, with curving fringes of foam
along the irregular shore cut by the indentations of the
firths. Now the sentries were more frequent and
more particular. Our single light gave dim form to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371">371</a></span>
the figures of sailors, soldiers, and boy scouts on
patrol.</p>

<p>“They’ve done remarkably well, these boys!” said
the officer. “Our fears that, boylike, they would see
all kinds of things which didn’t exist were quite needless.
The work has taught them a sense of responsibility
which will remain with them after the war, when
their experience will be a precious memory. They
realise that it isn’t play, but a serious business, and act
accordingly.”</p>

<p>With all the houses and the countryside dark, the
rays of our lamp seemed an invading comet to the men
who held up lanterns with red twinkles of warning.</p>

<p>“The patrol boats have complained about your
lights, sir!” said one obdurate sentry.</p>

<p>We looked out into the black wall in the direction
of the sea and could see no sign of a patrol boat.
How had it been able to inform this lone sentry of
that flying ray which disclosed the line of a coastal
road to any one at sea? He would not accept the best
argumentative burr that our chauffeur might produce
as sufficient explanation or guarantee. Most Scottish
of Scots in physiognomy and shrewd matter-of-factness,
as revealed in the glare of the lantern, he might
have been on watch in the Highland fastnesses in
Prince Charlie’s time.</p>

<p>“Captain R&mdash;&mdash;, of the Royal Navy!” explained
the officer, introducing himself.</p>

<p>“I’ll take your name and address!” said the sentry.</p>

<p>“The Admiralty. I take the responsibility.”</p>

<p>“As I’ll report, sir!” said the sentry, not so convinced
but he burred something further into the chauffeur’s
ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372">372</a></span>
This seems to have little to do with the navy, but it
has much, indeed, as a part of an unfathomable, complicated
business of guards within guards, intelligence
battling with intelligence, deceiving raiders by land or
sea, of those responsible for the safety of England
and the mastery of the seas.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It is from the navy yard that the ships go forth to
battle and to the navy yard they must return for supplies
and for the grooming beat of hammers in the dry
dock. Those who work at a navy yard keep the
navy’s house; welcome home all the family, from
Dreadnoughts to trawlers, give them cheer and shelter,
and bind up their wounds.</p>

<p>The quarter-deck of action for Admiral Lowry,
commanding the great base on the Forth, which was
begun before the war and hastened to completion since,
was a substantial brick office building. Adjoining his
office, where he worked with engineers’ blue prints as
well as with sea maps, he had fitted up a small bedroom
where he slept, to be at hand if any emergency
arose.</p>

<p>Partly we walked, as he showed us over his domain
of steam-shovels, machine shops, cement factories, of
building and repairs, of coaling and docking, and partly
we rode on a car that ran over temporary rails laid
for trucks loaded with rocks and dirt. Borrowing
from Peter to pay Paul, a river bottom had been filled
in back of the quays with material that had been excavated
to form a vast basin with cement walls, where
squadrons of Dreadnoughts might rest and await their
turn to be warped into the great dry docks which open
off it in chasmlike galleries.</p>

<p>“The largest contract in all England,” said the contractor.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373">373</a></span>
“And here is the man who checks up my
work,” he added, nodding to the lean, Scotch naval
civil engineer who was with us. It was clear from his
look that only material of the best quality and work
that was true would be acceptable to this canny mentor
of efficiency.</p>

<p>“And the workers? Have you had any strikes
here?”</p>

<p>“No. We have employed double the usual number
of men from the start of the war,” he said. “I’m
afraid that the Welsh coal troubles have been accepted
as characteristic. Our men have been reasonable and
patriotic. They’ve shown the right spirit. If they
hadn’t, how could we have accomplished that?”</p>

<p>We were looking down into the depths of a dry
dock blasted out of the rock, which had been begun
and completed within the year. And we had heard
nothing of all this through those twelve months! No
writer, no photographer, chronicled this silent labour!
Double lines of guards surrounded the place day and
night. Only tried patriots might enter this world of
a busy army in smudged workmen’s clothes, bending
to their tasks with that ordered discipline of industrialism
which wears no uniforms, marches without
beat of drums, and toils that the ships shall want nothing
to ensure victory.</p></div>

<span class="subhead">ON A DESTROYER</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Losing one’s heart to the British navy&mdash;“Specialised in torpedo
work”&mdash;Watching for submarines&mdash;Passing a flotilla&mdash;The
eyes of the navy&mdash;Cold on the bridge&mdash;A jumpy sea&mdash;Look
out for the spray&mdash;A symphony in mechanism&mdash;Around a bend
and: the sea power of England!</p></blockquote>

<p>Now we were on our way to the great thing&mdash;to our
look behind the curtain at the hidden hosts of sea-power.
Of some eight hundred tons’ burden our
steed, doing eighteen knots, which was a dog-trot for
one of her speed.</p>

<p>“A destroyer is like an automobile,” said the commander.
“If you rush her all the time she wears
out. We give her the limit only when necessary.”</p>

<p>On the bridge the zest of travel on a dolphin of steel
held the bridle on eagerness to reach the journey’s end.
We all like to see things well done and here one had
his first taste of how well things are done in the
British navy, which did not have to make ready for
war after the war began. With an open eye one went,
and the experience of other navies as a balance for his
observation; but one lost one’s heart to the British
navy and might as well confess it now. A six months’
cruise with our own battleship fleet was a proper introduction
to the experience. Never under any flag
not my own did I feel so much at home.</p>

<p>After the arduous monotony of the trenches and
after the traffic of London, it was freedom and sport
and ecstasy to be there, with the rush of salt air on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">375</a></span>
the face! Our commander was under thirty years of
age; and that destroyer responded to his will like a
stringed instrument. He seemed a part of her, her
nerves welded to his.</p>

<p>“Specialised in torpedo work,” he said, in answer
to a question. That is the way of the British navy:
to learn one thing well before you go on with another.
If in the course of it you learn how to command, larger
responsibilities await you. If not&mdash;there’s retired
pay.</p>

<p>Inside a shield which sheltered them from the spray
on the forward deck, significantly free of everything
but that four-inch gun, its crew was stationed. The
commander had only to lean over and speak through
a tube and give a range, and the music began. That
tube bifurcated at the end to an ear-mask over a
youngster’s head; a youngster who had real sailor’s
smiling blue eyes, like the commander’s own. For
hours he would sit waiting in the hope that game
would be sighted. No fisherman could be more patient
or more cheerful.</p>

<p>“Before he came into the navy he was a chauffeur.
He likes this,” said the commander.</p>

<p>“In case of a submarine you do not want to lose
any time; is that it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied. “You never can tell when we
might have a chance to put a shot into Fritz’s periscope
or ram him&mdash;Fritz is our name for submarines.”</p>

<p>Were all the commanders of destroyers up to his
mark, one wondered. How many more had the
British navy caught young and trained to such quickness
of decision and in the art of imparting it to his
men?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376">376</a></span>
Three hundred revolutions! The destroyer
changed speed. Five hundred! She changed speed
again.</p>

<p>Out of the mist in the distance flashed a white ribbon
knot that seemed to be tied to a destroyer’s bow
and behind it another destroyer, and still others, lean,
catlike, but running as if legless, with greased bodies
sliding over the sea. We snapped out some message
to them and they answered as passing birds on the
wing before they swept out of sight behind a headland
with uncanny ease of speed. How many destroyers
had England running to and fro in the North Sea,
keen for the chase and too quick at dodging and too
fast to be in any danger of the under-water dagger
thrust of the assassins whom they sought. We know
the figures in the naval lists, but there cannot be too
many. They are the eyes of the navy; they gather
information and carry a sting in their torpedo tubes.</p>

<p>It was chilly there on the bridge, with the prospect
too entrancing not to remain even if one froze. But
here stepped in naval preparedness with thick, short
coats of llama wool.</p>

<p>“Served out to all the men last winter, when we
were in the thick of it patrolling,” the commander explained.
“You’ll not get cold in that!”</p>

<p>“And yourself?” was suggested to the commander.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is not cold enough for that in September!
We’re hardened to it. You come from the land and
feel the change of air; we are at sea all the time,” he
replied. He was without even an overcoat; and the
ease with which he held his footing made land lubbers
feel their awkwardness.</p>

<p>A jumpy, uncertain tidal sea was running. Yet our
destroyer glided over the waves, cut through them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377">377</a></span>
played with them, and let them seem to play with her,
all the while laughing at them with the power of the
purring vitals that drove her steadily on.</p>

<p>“Look out!” which at the front in France was a
signal to jump for a “funk pit.” We ducked, as a
cloud of spray passed above the heavy canvas and
clattered like hail against the smokestack. “There
won’t be any more!” said the commander. He was
right. He knew that passage. One wondered if he
did not know every gallon of water in the North Sea,
which he had experienced in all its moods.</p>

<p>Sheltered by the smokestack down on the main deck,
one of our party, who loved not the sea for its own
sake but endured it as a passageway to the sight of
the Grand Fleet, had found warmth, if not comfort.
Not for him that invitation to come below given by
the chief engineer, who rose out of a round hole with
a pleasant, “How d’y do!” air to get a sniff of the
fresh breeze, wizard of the mysterious power of the
turbines which sent the destroyer marching so noiselessly.
He was the one who transferred the captain’s
orders into that symphony in mechanism. Turn a
lever and you had a dozen more knots; not with a leap
or a jerk, but like a cat’s sleek stretching of muscles.
Not by the slightest tremor did you realise the acceleration;
only by watching some stationary object as you
flew past.</p>

<p>Now a sweep of smooth water at the entrance to a
harbour, and a turn&mdash;and there it was: the sea power
of England!</p></div>

<span class="subhead">SHIPS THAT HAVE FOUGHT</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The “invisible” fleet&mdash;No chance for German submarines&mdash;No
end to the greyish blue-green monsters&mdash;the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>&mdash;Sea-power
and world power&mdash;Ships that have been under
fire&mdash;A German “mistake”&mdash;Sir David Beatty&mdash;“Youth for

gun-pointer&mdash;From the upper bridge&mdash;An impressive beauty&mdash;The
chase off Heligoland&mdash;Safe return of the <i>Lion</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>But was that really it? That spread of greyish blue-green
dots set on a huge greyish blue-green platter?
One could not discern where ships began and water
and sky which held them suspended left off. Invisible
fleet it had been called. At first glance it seemed to
be composed of baffling phantoms, absorbing the tone
of its background. Admiralty secrecy must be the result
of a naval dislike of publicity.</p>

<p>Still as if they were rooted, these leviathans!
How could such a shy, peaceful looking array send out
broadsides of twelve- and thirteen-five and fifteen-inch
shells? What a paradise for a German submarine!
Each ship seemed an inviting target. Only there
were many gates and doors to the paradise, closed to
all things that travel on and under the water without
a proper identification. Submarines that had tried
to pick one of the locks were like the fish who found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379">379</a></span>
going good into the trap. A submarine had about the
same chance of reaching that anchorage as a German
in the uniform of the Kaiser’s Death’s Head Hussars,
with a bomb under his arm, of reaching the vaults of
the Bank of England.</p>

<p>And was this all of the greatest naval force ever
gathered under a single command, these two or three
lines of ships? But as the destroyer drew nearer the
question changed. How many more? Was there
no end to greyish blue-green monsters, in order as precise
as the trees of a California orchard, appearing out
of the greyish blue-green background? First to claim
attention was the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>, with her eight fifteen-inch
guns on a platform which could travel at
nearly the speed of the average railroad train.</p>

<p>The contrast of sea and land warfare appealed the
more vividly to one fresh from the front in France.
What infinite labour for an army to get one big gun
into position! How heralded the snail-like travels of
the big German howitzer! Here was ship after ship,
whose guns seemed innumerable. One found it hard
to realise the resisting power of their armour, painted
to look as liquid as the sea, and the stability of their
construction, which was able to bear the strain of firing
the great shells that travelled ten miles to their
target.</p>

<p>Sea-power, indeed! And world power, too, there
in the hollow of a nation’s hand, to throw in whatever
direction she pleased. If an American had a lump in
his throat at the thought of what it meant, what might
it not mean to an Englishman? Probably the Englishman
would say, “I think that the fleet is all right,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>Land-power, too! On the Continent vast armies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380">380</a></span>
wrestled for some square miles of earth. France has,
say, three million soldiers; Germany, five; Austria,
four&mdash;and England had, perhaps, a hundred thousand
men, perhaps more, on board this fleet which defended
the English land and lands far over seas without
firing a shot. One American regiment of infantry
is more than sufficient in numbers to man a Dreadnought.
How precious, then, the skill of that crew!
Man-power is as concentrated as gun-power with a
navy. Ride three hundred miles in an automobile
along an army front, with glimpses of units of soldiers,
and you have seen little of a modern army.
Here, moving down the lanes that separated these
grey fighters, one could compass the whole!</p>

<p>Four gold letters, spelling the word Lion, awakened
the imagination to the concrete of the <i>Blücher</i> turning
her bottom skyward before she sank off the Dogger
Bank under the fire of the guns of the <i>Lion</i> and of the
<i>Tiger</i>, astern of her, and the <i>Princess Royal</i> and the
<i>New Zealand</i>, of the latest fashion in battle-cruiser
squadrons which are known as the “cat” squadron.
This work brought them into their own; proved how
the British, who built the first Dreadnought, have kept
a little ahead of their rivals in construction. With almost
the gun-power of Dreadnoughts, better than
three to two against the best battleships, with the
speed of cruisers and capable of overwhelming
cruisers, or of pursuing any battleship, or getting
out of range, they can run or strike, as they
please.</p>

<p>Ascend that gangway, so amazingly clean, as were
the decks above and below and everything about the
<i>Lion</i> or the <i>Tiger</i>, and you were on board one of the
few major ships which had been under heavy fire.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381">381</a></span>
Her officers and men knew what modern naval war
was like; her guns knew the difference between the
wall of cloth of a towed target and an enemy’s wall of
armour.</p>

<p>In the battle of Tsushima Straits battleships had
fought at three and four thousand yards and closed
into much shorter range. Since then, we had had the
new method of marksmanship. Tsushima ceased to
be a criterion. The Dogger Bank multiplied the
range by five. A hundred years since England, all
the while the most powerfully armed nation at sea,
had been in a naval war of the first magnitude; and
to the <i>Lion</i> and the <i>Tiger</i> had come the test. The
Germans said that they had sunk the <i>Tiger</i>; but the
<i>Tiger</i> afloat purred a contented denial.</p>

<p>One could not fail to identify among the group of
officers on the quarter-deck Vice-Admiral Sir David
Beatty, for his victory had impressed his features on
the public’s eye. Had his portrait not appeared in
the press, one would have been inclined to say that a
first lieutenant had put on a vice-admiral’s coat by mistake.
He was about the age of the first lieutenant of
our own battleships. Even as it was, one was inclined
to exclaim: “There is some mistake! You are too
young!” The Who is Who book says that he is all
of forty-four years old and it must be right, though it
disagrees with his appearance by five years. A vice-admiral
at forty-four! A man who is a rear-admiral
with us at fifty-five is very precocious. And all the
men around him were young. The British navy did
not wait for war to teach again the lesson of “youth
for action!” It saved time by putting youth in
charge at once.</p>

<p>Their simple uniforms, the directness, alertness, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382">382</a></span>
definiteness of these officers, who had been with a fleet
ready for a year to go into battle on a minute’s notice,
was in keeping with their surroundings of decks
cleared for action and the absence of anything which
did not suggest that hitting a target was the business
of their life.</p>

<p>“I had heard that you took your admirals from the
school-room,” said one of the Frenchmen, “but I begin
to believe that it is the nursery.”</p>

<p>Night and day they must be on watch. No easy-chairs;
their shop is their home. They must have the
vitality that endures a strain. One error in battle by
any one of them might wreck the British Empire.</p>

<p>It is difficult to write about any man-of-war and not
be technical; for everything about her seems technical
and mechanical except the fact that she floats. Her
officers and crew are engaged in work which is legerdermain
to the civilian.</p>

<p>“Was it like what you thought it would be after
all your training for a naval action?” one asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, quite; pretty much as we reasoned it out,”
was the reply. “Indeed, this was the most remarkable
thing. It was battle practice&mdash;with the other
fellow shooting at you!”</p>

<p>The fire-control officers, who were aloft, all agreed
about one unexpected sensation, which had not occurred
to any expert scientifically predicating what
action would be like. They are the only ones, who
may really “see” the battle in the full sense.</p>

<p>“When the shells burst against the armour,” said
one of these officers, “the fragments were visible as
they flew about. We had a desire, in the midst of
our preoccupation with our work, to reach out and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383">383</a></span>
catch them. Singular mental phenomenon, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>At eight or nine thousand yards one knew that the
modern battleship could tear a target to pieces. But
eighteen thousand&mdash;was accuracy possible at that distance?</p>

<p>“Did one in five German shells hit at that range?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>Or in ten? No! In twenty? Still no, though
less decisively. One got a conviction, then, that the
day of holding your fire until you were close in enough
for a large percentage of hits was past. Accuracy
was still vital and decisive, but generic accuracy. At
eighteen thousand yards all the factors which send a
thousand or fifteen hundred or two thousand pounds
of steel that long distance cannot be so gauged that
each one will strike in exactly the same line when ten
issue from the gun-muzzles in a broadside. But if
one out of twenty is on at eighteen thousand yards, it
may mean a turret out of action. Again, four or five
might hit, or none. So, no risk of waiting may be
taken, in face of the danger of a chance shot at long
range. It was a chance shot which struck the <i>Lion’s</i>
feed tank and disabled her and kept the cat squadron
from doing to the other German cruisers what they
had done to the <i>Blücher</i>.</p>

<p>“And the noise of it to you aloft, spotting the
shots?” I suggested. “It must have been a lonely
place in such a tornado.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Besides the crashing blasts from our own
guns we had the screams of the shells that went over
and the cataracts of water from those short sprinkling
the ship with spray. But this was what one expected.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384">384</a></span>
Everything was what one expected, except that desire
to catch the fragments. Naturally, one was too busy
to think much of anything except the enemy’s ships&mdash;to
learn where your shells were striking.”</p>

<p>“You could tell?”</p>

<p>“Yes, just as well and better than at target practice
for the target was larger and solid. It was enthralling,
that watching the flight of our shells toward their
target.”</p>

<p>Where were the scars from the wounds? One
looked for them on both the <i>Lion</i> and the <i>Tiger</i>.
That armour patch on the sloping top of a turret might
have escaped attention if it had not been pointed out.
A shell struck there and a fair blow, too. And what
happened inside? Was the turret gear put out of
order?</p>

<p>To one who has lived in a wardroom a score of
questions were on the tongue’s end. The turret is the
basket which holds the precious eggs. A turret out
of action means two guns out of action; a broken
knuckle for the pugilist.</p>

<p>Constructors have racked their brains over the subject
of turrets in the old contest between gun-power
and protection. Too much gun-power, too little
armour! Too much armour, too little gun-power!
Off the Virginia capes we have pounded antiquated
battleships with shells as a test, with sheep inside the
turrets to see if life could survive. But in the last
analysis results depend on how good is your armour,
how sound your machinery which rotates the turret.
That shell did not go through bodily, only a fragment,
which killed one man and wounded another.
The turret would still rotate; the other gun remained
in action and the one under the shell-burst was soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385">385</a></span>
back in action. Very satisfactory to the naval constructors.</p>

<p>Up and down the all-but perpendicular steel ladders
with their narrow steps, and through the winding passages
below decks in those cities of steel, one followed
his guide, receiving so much information and so many
impressions that he was confused as to details between
the two veterans, the <i>Lion</i>, which was hit fifteen times,
and the <i>Tiger</i>, which was hit eight. Wherever you
went every square inch of space and every bit of equipment
seemed to serve some purpose.</p>

<p>A beautiful hit, indeed, was that into a small hooded
aperture where an observer looked out from a turret.
He was killed and another man took his place. Fresh
armour and no sign of where the shot had struck.
Then below, into a compartment between the side of
the ship and the armoured barbette which protects the
delicate machinery for feeding shells and powder from
the magazine deep below the water to the guns.</p>

<p>“H&mdash;&mdash; was killed here. Impact of the shell passing
through the outer plates burst it inside; and, of
course, the fragments struck harmlessly against the
barbette.”</p>

<p>“Bang in the dugout!” one exclaimed, from army
habit.</p>

<p>“Precisely! No harm done next door.”</p>

<p>Trench traverses and “funk-pit shelters” for localising
the effects of shell-bursts are the terrestrial
expression of marine construction. No one shell happened
to get many men either on the <i>Lion</i> or the
<i>Tiger</i>. But the effect of the burst was felt in the
passages, for the air-pressure is bound to be pronounced
in enclosed spaces which allow of little room
for the expansion of the gases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386">386</a></span>
Then up more ladders out of the electric light into
the daylight, hugging a wall of armour whose thickness
was revealed in the cut made for the small doorway
which you were bidden to enter. Now you were
in one of the brain-centres of the ship, where the action
is directed. Through slits in that massive shelter of
the hardest steel one had a narrow view. Above
them on the white wall were silhouetted diagrams of
the different types of German ships, which one found
in all observing stations. They were the most popular
form of mural decoration in the British navy.</p>

<p>Underneath the slits was a literal panoply of the
brass fittings of speaking-tubes and levers and push-buttons,
which would have puzzled even the “Hello,
Central” girl. To look at them revealed nothing
more than the eye saw; nothing more than the face of
a watch reveals of the character of its works. There
was no telling how they ran in duplicate below the
water line or under the protection of armour to the
guns and the engines.</p>

<p>“We got one in here, too. It was a good one!”
said the host.</p>

<p>“Junk, of course,” was how he expressed the result.
Here, too, a man stepped forward to take the
place of the man who was killed, just as the first lieutenant
takes the place of a captain of infantry who
falls. With the whole telephone apparatus blown off
the wall, as it were, how did he communicate?</p>

<p>“There!” The host pointed toward an opening
at his feet. If that failed there was still another way.
In the final alternative, each turret could go on firing
by itself. So the Germans must have done on the
<i>Blücher</i> and on the <i>Gneisenau</i> and the <i>Scharnhorst</i> in
their last ghastly moments of bloody chaos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387">387</a></span>
“If this is carried away and then that is, why, then,
we have&mdash;” as one had often heard officers say on
board our own ships. But that was hypothesis. Here
was demonstration, which made a glimpse of the <i>Lion</i>
and the <i>Tiger</i> so interesting. The <i>Lion</i> had had a
narrow escape from going down after being hit in the
feed tank; but once in dry dock, all her damaged parts
had been renewed. Particularly it required imagination
to realise that this tower had ever been struck;
visually, more convincing was a plate elsewhere which
had been left unpainted, showing a spatter of dents
from shell-fragments.</p>

<p>“We thought that we ought to have something to
prove that we had been in battle,” said the host. “I
think I’ve shown all the hits. There were not many.”</p>

<p>Having seen the results of German gun-fire, we
were next to see the methods of British gun-fire; something
of the guns and the men who did things to the
Germans. One stooped under the overhang of the
turret armour from the barbette and climbed up
through an opening which allowed no spare room for
the generously built, and out of the dim light appeared
the glint of the massive steel breech block and gun,
set in its heavy recoil mountings with roots of steel
supports sunk into the very structure of the ship. It
was like other guns of the latest improved type; but it
had been in action, and one kept thinking of this fact
that gave it a sort of majestic prestige. One wished
that it might look a little different from the others, as
the right of a veteran.</p>

<p>As the plugman swung the breech open I had in
mind a giant plugman on the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;S. <i>Connecticut</i>
whom I used to watch at drills and target practice.
Shall I ever forget the flash in his eye if there were a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388">388</a></span>
fraction of a second’s delay in the firing after the
breech had gone home! The way in which he made
that enormous block obey his touch in oily obsequiousness
suggested the apotheosis of the whole business of
naval war. I don’t know whether the plugman of H.
M.&nbsp;S. <i>Lion</i> or the plugman of the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;S. <i>Connecticut</i>
was the better. It would take a superman to improve
on either.</p>

<p>Like the block, it seemed as if the man knew only
the movements of the drill; as if he had been bred
and his muscles formed for that. One could conceive
of him playing diavolo with that breech. He belonged
to the finest part of all the machinery, the human
element, which made the parts of a steel machine
play together in a beautiful harmony.</p>

<p>The plugman’s is the most showy part; others
playing equally important parts are in the cavern below
the turret; and most important of all is that of
the man who keeps the gun on the target, whose true
right eye may send twenty-five thousand tons of battleship
to perdition. No one eye of any enlisted man
can be as important as the gun-pointer’s. His the eye
and the nerve trained as finely as the plugman’s
muscles. He does nothing else, thinks of nothing else.
In common with painters and poets, gun-pointers are
born with a gift, and that gift is trained and trained
and trained. It seems simple to keep right on, but it
is not. Try twenty men in the most rudimentary test
and you will find that it is not; then think of the nerve
it takes to keep right on in battle, with your ship
shaken by the enemy’s hits.</p>

<p>How long had the plugman been on his job? Six
years. And the gun-pointer? Seven. Twelve years
is the term of enlistment in the British navy. Not too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389">389</a></span>
fast but thoroughly, is the British way. The idea is
to make a plugman or a gun-pointer the same kind of
expert as a master artisan in any other walk of life,
by long service and selection.</p>

<p>None of all these men serving the two guns from
the depths to the turret saw anything of the battle,
except the gun-pointer. It was easier for them than
for him to be letter-perfect in the test, as he had to
guard against the exhilaration of having an enemy’s
ship instead of a cloth target under his eye. Super-drilled
he was to that eventuality; super-drilled all the
others through the years, till each one knew his part
as well as one knows how to turn the key in the lock
of his bureau. Used to the shock of the discharges
of their own guns at battle practice, many of the crew
did not even know that their ship was hit, so preoccupied
was each with his own duty, which was to go on
with it until an order or a shell’s havoc stopped him.
Every mind was closed except to the thing which had
been so established by drill in his nature that he did it
instinctively.</p>

<p>A few minutes later one was looking down from the
upper bridge on the top of this turret and the black-lined
planking of the deck eighty-five feet below, with
the sweep of the firm lines of the sides converging toward
the bow on the background of the water. Suddenly
the ship seemed to have grown large, impressive;
her structure had a rocklike solidity. Her
beauty was in her unadorned strength. One was absorbing
the majesty of a city from a cathedral tower
after having been in its thoroughfares and seen the
detail of its throbbing industry.</p>

<p>Beyond the <i>Lion’s</i> bow were more ships, and port
and starboard and aft were still more ships. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390">390</a></span>
compass range filled the eye with the stately precision
of the many squadrons and divisions of leviathans.
One could see all the fleet. This seemed to be the
scenic climax; but it was not, as we were to learn when
we should see the fleet go to sea. Then we were to behold
the mountains on the march.</p>

<p>One glanced back at the deck and around the bridge
with a sort of relief. The infinite was making him
dizzy. He wanted to be in touch with the finite again.
But it is the writer, not the practical, hardened seaman,
who is affected in this way. To the seaman, here
was a battle-cruiser with her sister battle-cruisers
astern, and there around her were Dreadnoughts of
different types and pre-Dreadnoughts and cruisers and
all manner of other craft which could fight each in its
way, each representing so much speed and so much
metal which could be thrown a certain distance.</p>

<p>“Homogeneity!” Another favourite word, I remember,
from our own wardrooms. Here it was applied
in the large. No experimental ships there, no
freak variations of type, but each successive type as a
unit of action. Homogeneous, yes&mdash;remorselessly
homogeneous. The British do not simply build some
ships; they build a navy. And of course the experts
are not satisfied with it; if they were, the British navy
would be in a bad way. But a layman was; he was
overwhelmed.</p>

<p>From this bridge of the <i>Lion</i> on the morning of
the 24th of January, 1914, Vice-Admiral Sir David
Beatty saw appear on the horizon a sight inexpressibly
welcome to any commander who has scoured the seas
in the hope that the enemy will come out in the open
and give battle. Once that German battle-cruiser
squadron had slipped across the North Sea and, under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391">391</a></span>
cover of the mist which has ever been the friend of the
pirate, bombarded the women and children of Scarborough
and the Hartlepools with shells meant to be
fired at hardened adult males sheltered behind
armour; and then, thanks to the mist, they had slipped
back to Heligoland with cheering news to the women
and children of Germany. This time when they came
out they encountered a British battle-cruiser squadron
of superior speed and power, and they had to fight as
they ran for home.</p>

<p>Now, the place of an admiral is in his conning
tower after he has made his deployments and the firing
has begun. He, too, is a part of the machine; his
position defined, no less than the plugman’s and the
gun-pointer’s. Sir David watched the ranging shots
which fell short at first, until finally they were on, and
the Germans were beginning to reply. When his
staff warned him that he ought to go below, he put
them off with a preoccupied shake of his head. He
could not resist the temptation to remain where he
was, instead of being shut up looking through the slits
of a visor.</p>

<p>But an admiral is as vulnerable to shell-fragments
as a midshipman, and the staff did its duty, which had
been thought out beforehand like everything else.
The argument was on their side; the commander really
had none on his. It was then that Vice-Admiral
Beatty sent Sir David Beatty to the conning tower,
much to the personal disgust of Sir David, who envied
the observing officers aloft their free sweep of vision.</p>

<p>Youth in Sir David’s case meant suppleness of limbs
as well as youth’s spirit and dash. When the <i>Lion</i>
was disabled by the shot in her feed tank and had to
fall out of line, Sir David must transfer his flag. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392">392</a></span>
signalled for his destroyer, the <i>Attack</i>. When she
came alongside, he did not wait on a ladder, but
jumped on board her from the deck of the <i>Lion</i>. An
aged vice-admiral with chalky bones might have
broken some of them, or at least received a shock to
his presence of mind.</p>

<p>Before he left the <i>Lion</i> Sir David had been the first
to see the periscope of a German submarine in the
distance, which sighted the wounded ship as inviting
prey. Officers of the <i>Lion</i> dwelt more on the cruise
home than on the battle. It was a case of being towed
at five knots an hour by the Indomitable. If ever submarines
had a fair chance to show what they could do
it was then against that battleship at a snail’s pace.
But it is one thing to torpedo a merchant craft and another
to get a major fighting ship, bristling with torpedo
defence guns and surrounded by destroyers.
The <i>Lion</i> reached port without further injury.</p></div>

<span class="subhead">ON THE “INFLEXIBLE”</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Veterans of the Dardanelles&mdash;“The range of them”&mdash;The Falkland
affair&mdash;The “double bluff” on von Spee&mdash;The intercepted
British wireless&mdash;Sturdee’s trap&mdash;Story book of strategy&mdash;The
Germans go down with their colours flying&mdash;Only a disordered
wardroom&mdash;The chaplain’s anecdote&mdash;All a lark for
the midshipman&mdash;Souvenirs of action.</p></blockquote>

<p>What Englishman, let alone an American, knows the
names of even all the British Dreadnoughts? With a
few exceptions, the units of the Grand Fleet seem
anonymous. The <i>Warspite</i> was quite unknown to the
fame which her sister ship the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> had
won. For “<i>Lizzie</i>” was back in the fold from the
Dardanelles; and so was the <i>Inflexible</i>, flagship of the
battle of the Falkland Islands. Of all the ships which
Sir John Jellicoe had sent away on special missions,
the <i>Inflexible</i> had had the grandest Odyssey. She,
too, had been at the Dardanelles.</p>

<p>The <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> was disappointing so far as
wounds went. She had been so much in the public
eye that one expected to find her badly battered, and
she had suffered little, indeed, for the amount of sport
she had had in tossing her fifteen-inch shells across the
Gallipoli peninsula into the Turkish batteries and the
amount of risk she had run from Turkish mines.
Some of these monster shells contained only eleven
thousand shrapnel bullets. A strange business for a
fifteen-inch naval gun to be firing shrapnel. A year
ago no one could have imagined that one day the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394">394</a></span>
most powerful British ship, built with the single
thought of overwhelming an enemy’s Dreadnought,
would ever be trying to force the Dardanelles.</p>

<p>The trouble was that she could not fire an army
corps ashore along with her shells to take possession
of any batteries she put out of action. She had some
grand target practice; she escaped the mines; she kept
out of reach of the German shells, and returned to report
to Sir John with just enough scars to give zest to
the recollection of her extraordinary adventure. All
the fleet was relieved to see her back in her proper
place. It is not the business of super-Dreadnoughts
to be steaming around mine-fields, but to be surrounded
by destroyers and light cruisers and submarines safeguarding
her giant guns which are depressed and elevated
as easily as if they were drum-sticks. One had
an abrasion, a tracery of dents.</p>

<p>“That was from a Turkish shell,” said an officer.
“And you are standing where a shell hit.”</p>

<p>One looked down to see an irregular outline of
fresh planking.</p>

<p>“An accident when we did not happen to be out of
their reach. We had the range of them,” he added.</p>

<p>“The range of them” is a great phrase. Sir
Frederick Doveton Sturdee used it in speaking of the
battle of the Falkland Islands. “The range of
them” seems a sure prescription for victory. Nothing
in all the history of the war appeals to me as quite
so smooth a bit of tactics as the Falkland affair. It
was so smooth that it was velvety; and it is worth telling
again, as I understand it. Sir Frederick is another
young admiral. Otherwise, how could the
British navy have entrusted him with so important a
task? He is a different type from Beatty, who in an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395">395</a></span>
army one judges might have been in the cavalry.
Along with the peculiar charm and alertness which we
associate with sailors&mdash;they imbibe it from the salt
air and from meeting all kinds of weather and all kinds
of men, I think&mdash;he has the quality of the scholar,
with a suspicion of merriness in his eye.</p>

<p>He was Chief of Staff at the Admiralty in the early
stages of the war, which means, I take it, that he assisted
in planning the moves on the chessboard. It
fell to him to act; to apply the strategy and tactics
which he planned for others at sea while he sat at a
desk. It was his wit against von Spee’s, who was not
deficient in this respect. If he had been he might not
have steamed into the trap. The trouble was that
von Spee had some wit, but not enough. It would
have been better for him if he had been as guileless as
a parson.</p>

<p>Sir Frederick is so gentle-mannered that one would
never suspect him of a “double bluff,” which was what
he played on von Spee. After von Spee’s victory over
Cradock, Sturdee slipped across to the South Atlantic,
without any one knowing that he had gone, with a
squadron strong enough to do unto von Spee what von
Spee had done unto Cradock.</p>

<p>But before you wing your bird you must flush him.
The thing was to find von Spee and force him to give
battle; for the South Atlantic is broad and von Spee,
it is supposed, was in an Emden mood and bent on
reaching harbour in German Southwest Africa,
whence he could sally out to destroy British shipping
on the Cape route. When he intercepted a British
wireless message&mdash;Sturdee had left off the sender’s
name and location&mdash;telling the plodding old <i>Canopus</i>
seeking home or assistance before von Spee overtook<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396">396</a></span>
her, that she would be perfectly safe in the harbour at
Port William, as guns had been erected for her protection,
von Spee guessed that this was a bluff, and
rightly. But it was only Bluff Number One. He
steamed to the Falklands with a view to finishing off
the old <i>Canopus</i> on the way across to Africa. There
he fell foul of Bluff Number Two. Sturdee did not
have to seek him; he came to Sturdee.</p>

<p>There was no convenient Dogger Bank fog in that
latitude to cover his flight. Sturdee had the speed of
von Spee and he had to fight. It was the one bit of
strategy of the war which is like that of the story
books and worked out as the strategy always does in
proper story books. Practically the twelve-inch guns
of the <i>Inflexible</i> and the <i>Invincible</i> had only to keep
their distance and hang on to the <i>Scharnhorst</i> and the
<i>Gneisenau</i> in order to do the trick. Light-weights or
middle-weights have no business trafficking with
heavy-weights in naval warfare.</p>

<p>“Von Spee made a brave fight,” said Sir Frederick,
“but we kept him at a distance that suited us, without
letting him get out of range.”</p>

<p>He had had the fortune to prove an established principle
in action. It was all in the course of duty, which
is the way that all the officers and all the men look at
their work. Only a few ships have had a chance to
fight and these are emblazoned on the public memory.
But they did no better and no worse, probably, than
the others would have done. If the public singles out
ships, the navy does not. Whatever is done and whoever
does it, why, it is to the credit of the family, according
to the spirit of service that promotes uniformity
of efficiency. Leaders and ships which have
won renown are resolved into the whole in that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397">397</a></span>
harbour where the fleet is the thing; and the good
opinion they most desire is that of their fellows. If
they have that, they will earn the public’s when the
test comes.</p>

<p>Belonging to the class of the first of battle-cruisers
is the <i>Inflexible</i>, which received a few taps in the
Falklands and a blow that was nearly the death of her
in the Dardanelles. Tribute enough for its courage&mdash;the
tribute of a chivalrous enemy&mdash;von Spee’s
squadron receives from the officers and men of the <i>Inflexible</i>,
who saw them go down into the sea tinged
with sunset red with their colours still flying. Then in
the sunset red the British saved as many of those afloat
as they could.</p>

<p>Those dripping German officers who had seen one
of their battered turrets carried away bodily into the
sea by a British twelve-inch shell, who had endured a
fury of concussions and destruction, with steel missiles
cracking steel structures into fragments, came on board
the <i>Inflexible</i> looking for signs of some blows delivered
in return for the crushing blows that had
beaten their ships into the sea and saw none until they
were invited into the wardroom, which was in chaos&mdash;and
then they smiled.</p>

<p>At least, they had sent one shell home. The sight
was sweet to them, so sweet that, in respect to the feeling
of the vanquished, the victor held silence with a
knightly consideration. But where had the shell entered?
There was no sign of any hole. Then they
learned that the fire of the guns of the starboard turret
midships over the wardroom, which was on the port
side, had deposited a great many things on the floor
which did not belong there; and their expression
changed. Even this comfort was taken from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398">398</a></span>
“We had the range of you!” the British explained.</p>

<p>The chaplain of the <i>Inflexible</i> was bound to have an
anecdote. I don’t know why, except that a chaplain’s
is not a fighting part and he may look on. His
place was down behind the armour with the doctor,
waiting for wounded. He stood in his particular
steel cave listening to the tremendous blasts of her
guns which shook the <i>Inflexible’s</i> frame, and still no
wounded arrived. Then he ran up a ladder to the
deck and had a look around and saw the little points
of the German ships with the shells sweeping toward
them and the smoke of explosions which burst on
board them. It was not the British who needed his
prayers that day, but the Germans.</p>

<p>Perhaps the spirit of the <i>Inflexible’s</i> story was best
given by a midshipman with the down still on his
cheek. Considering how young the British take their
officer-beginners to sea, the admirals are not young,
at least, in point of sea service. He got more out of
the action than his elders; his impressions of the long
cruises and the actions had the vividness of boyhood.
Down in one of the caves, doing his part as the shells
were sent up to feed the thundering guns above, the
whispered news of the progress of the battle was
passed on at intervals till, finally, the guns were silent.
Then he hurried on deck in the elation of victory, succeeded
by the desire to save those whom they had
fought. It had all been so simple; so like drill. You
had only to go on shooting&mdash;that was all.</p>

<p>Yes, he had been lucky. From the Falklands to
the Dardanelles, which was a more picturesque business
than the battle. Any minute off the Straits you
did not know but a submarine would have a try at you
or you might bump into a mine. And the <i>Inflexible</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399">399</a></span>
did bump into one. She had two thousand tons of
water on board. It was fast work to keep the remainder
of the sea from coming in, too, and the same
kind of dramatic experience as the <i>Lion’s</i> in reaching
port. Yes, he had been very lucky. It was all a lark
to that boy.</p>

<p>“It never occurs to midshipmen to be afraid of
anything,” said one of the officers. “The more danger,
the better they like it.”</p>

<p>In the wardroom was a piece of the mine or the
torpedo, whichever it was, that struck the <i>Inflexible</i>;
a strange, twisted, annealed bit of metal. Every ship
which had been in action had some souvenir which the
enemy had sent on board in anger and which was preserved
with a collector’s enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The <i>Inflexible</i> seemed as good as ever she was.
Such is the way of naval warfare. Either it is to the
bottom of the sea or to dry docks and repairs. There
is nothing half way. So it is well to take care that
you have “the range of them.”</p></div>

<span class="subhead">ON THE FLEET FLAGSHIP</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The “grande dames” of the fleet&mdash;The boarding&mdash;Nelson’s heritage&mdash;Guardians
of the peace of the seas&mdash;Sir John Jellicoe&mdash;The
China seas incident&mdash;The compliment returned at
Manila Bay&mdash;Friends in the service&mdash;That command of
Joshua’s&mdash;Waiting and watching&mdash;England’s true genius&mdash;A
complete blockade&mdash;Intricate and concentrated mechanism&mdash;Personality
of Sir John&mdash;The spirit of service.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus far we have skirted around the heart of things,
which in a fleet is always the commander-in-chief’s
flagship. Our handy, agile destroyer ran alongside
a battleship with as much nonchalance as she would
go alongside a pier. I should not have been surprised
to have seen her pirouette over the hills or take
to flight.</p>

<p>There was a time when those majestic and pampered
ladies, the battleships&mdash;particularly if a sea were running
as there was in this harbour at the time&mdash;having
in mind the pride of paint, begged all destroyers
to keep off with the superciliousness of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grandes dames</i>
holding their skirts aloof from contact with nimble,
audacious street gamins, who dodged in and out of
the traffic of muddy streets. But destroyers have
learned better manners, perhaps, and battleships have
been democratised. It is the day of Russian dancers
and when aeroplanes loop the loop, and we have grown
used to all kinds of marvels.</p>

<p>But the sea has refused to be trained. It is the
same old sea that it was in Columbus’ time, without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401">401</a></span>
any loss of trickiness in bumping small craft against
towering sides. The way that this destroyer slid up
to the flagship without any fuss and the way her bluejackets
held off from the paint as she rose on the crests
and slipped back into the trough, did not tell the whole
story. A part of it was how, at the right interval,
they assisted the landlubber to step from gunwale to
gangway, making him feel perfectly safe when he
would have been perfectly helpless but for them.</p>

<p>I had often watched our own bluejackets at the
same thing. They did not grin&mdash;not when you were
looking at them. Nor did the British. Bluejackets
are noted for their official politeness. I should like
to have heard their remarks&mdash;they have a gift for
remarks&mdash;about those invaders of their uniformed
world in Scotch caps and other kinds of caps and the
different kind of clothes which tailors make for civilians.
Without any intention of eavesdropping, I did
overhear one asking another whence came these
strange birds.</p>

<p>One knew the flagship by the admirals’ barges
astern, as you know the location of an army headquarters
by its automobiles. It seemed in the centre
of the fleet at anchor, if that is a nautical expression.
Where its place would be in action is one of those
secrets as important to the enemy as the location of a
general’s shell-proof shelter in Flanders. Perhaps Sir
John Jellicoe may be on some other ship in battle.
If there is any one foolish question which one should
not ask it is this.</p>

<p>As one mounted the gangway of this mighty super-Dreadnought
one was bound to think of another flagship
in Portsmouth harbour, Nelson’s <i>Victory</i>&mdash;at
least, an American was. Probably an Englishman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402">402</a></span>
would not indulge in such a commonplace. One would
like to know how many Englishmen had ever seen the
old <i>Victory</i>. But, then, how many Americans have
been to Mount Vernon and Gettysburg?</p>

<p>It was a hundred years, one repeats, since the British
had fought a first-class naval war. Nelson did his
part so well that he did not leave any fighting to be
done by his successors. Maintaining herself as mistress
of the seas by the threat of superior strength&mdash;except
in the late fifties, when the French innovation
of iron ships gave France a temporary lead on paper&mdash;ship
after ship, through all the grades of progress
in naval construction, has gone to the scrap heap without
firing a shot in anger.</p>

<p>The <i>Victory</i> was one landmark, or seamark, if you
please, and this flagship was another. Between the
two were generations of officers and men working
through the change from stagecoach to motors and
aeroplanes and seaplanes, who had kept up to a standard
of efficiency in view of a test that never came. A
year of war and still the test had not come, for the old
reason that England had superior strength. Her outnumbering
guns which had kept the peace of the seas
still kept it.</p>

<p>All second nature to the Englishman this, as the
defence of the immense distances of the steppes to the
Russian or the Rocky Mountain wall and the Mississippi’s
flow to the man in Kansas. But the American
kept thinking about it; and he wanted the Kansans to
think about it, too. A sentimentalist envisaged the
tall column in Trafalgar Square, with the one-armed
figure turned toward the wireless skein on top of the
Admiralty Building when he went on board the flagship
of Sir John Jellicoe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403">403</a></span>
One first heard of Jellicoe fifteen years ago on the
China coast, when he was Chief of Staff to Sir Edward
Seymour, then Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic
Squadron. Indeed, one was always hearing about
Jellicoe. He was the kind of man whom people talk
about after they have met him, which means personality.
It was in China seas, you may remember, that
when a few British seamen were hard pressed in a
fight that was not ours that the phrase, “Blood is
thicker than water,” sprang from the lips of an American
commander, who waited not on international
etiquette but went to the assistance of the British.</p>

<p>Nor will any one who was present in the summer
of ’98 forget how Sir Edward Chichester stood loyally
by Admiral George Dewey, when the German squadron
was empire-fishing in the waters of Manila Bay,
until our Atlantic Fleet had won the battle of Santiago
and Admiral Dewey had received reinforcements and,
east and west, we were able to look after the Germans.
The British bluejackets said that the rations of frozen
mutton from Australia which we sent alongside were
excellent; but the Germans were in no position to
judge, as none was sent to them, doubtless through an
oversight in the detail of hospitality by one of Admiral
Dewey’s staff. No. Let us be officially correct.
We happened to run out of spare mutton after serving
the British.</p>

<p>In the gallant effort of the Allied force of sailors
to relieve the legations against some hundreds of thousands
of Boxers, Captain Bowman McCalla and his
Americans worked with Admiral Seymour and his
Britons in the most trying and picturesque thing of
its kind in modern history. McCalla, too, was always
talking of Jellicoe, who was wounded on the expedition;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404">404</a></span>
and Sir John’s face lighted at mention of McCalla’s
name. He recalled how McCalla had painted
on the superstructure of the little <i>Newark</i> that saying
of Farragut’s, “The best protection against an enemy’s
fire is a well-directed fire of your own”; which
has been said in other ways and cannot be said too
often.</p>

<p>“We called McCalla Mr. Lead,” said Sir John;
“he had been wounded so many times and yet was
able to hobble along and keep on fighting. I corresponded
regularly with him until his death.”</p>

<p>Beatty, too, was on that expedition; and he, too,
was another personality one kept hearing about. It
seemed odd that two men, who had played a part in
work which was a soldier’s far from home, should
have become so conspicuous in the Great War. If on
that day when, with ammunition exhausted, all members
of the expedition had given up hope of ever returning
alive, they had not accidentally come upon the
Shi-kou arsenal, one would not be commanding the
Great Fleet and the other its battle-cruiser squadron.</p>

<p>Before the war, I am told, when Admiralty lords
and others who had the decision to make were discussing
who should command in case of war, opinion
ran something like this:</p>

<p>“Jellicoe! He has the brains!”</p>

<p>“Jellicoe! He has the health to endure the strain,
with years enough and not too many!”</p>

<p>“Jellicoe! He has the confidence of the service!”</p>

<p>The choice literally made itself. When any one is
undertaking the gravest responsibility which has been
an Englishman’s for a hundred years, that kind of a
recommendation helps. He had the guns; he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405">405</a></span>
supreme command; he must deliver victory&mdash;such
was England’s message to him.</p>

<p>When I mentioned in a despatch that all that differentiated
him from the officers around him was the
broader band of gold lace on his arm, an English naval
critic wanted to know if I expected to find him in cloth
of gold. No; nor in full dress with all his medals
on, as I saw him appear on the screen at a theatre in
London.</p>

<p>Any general of high command must be surrounded
by more pomp than an admiral in time of action. A
headquarters cannot have the simplicity of the quarter-deck.
The force which the general commands is not
in sight; the admiral’s is. You saw the commander
and you saw what it was that he commanded. Within
the sweep of vision from the quarter-deck was the
terrific power which the man with the broad gold band
on his arm directed. At a signal from him it would
move or it would stand still. That command of
Joshua’s if given by Sir John one thought might have
been obeyed.</p>

<p>One hundred, two hundred, three hundred, four
hundred twelve-inch guns and larger, which could carry
a hundred tons and more of metal in a single broadside
for a distance of eighteen thousand yards! But do
not forget the little guns, bristling under the big guns
like needles from a cushion, which would keep off the
torpedo assassins; or the light cruisers, or the colliers,
or the destroyers, or the 2,300 trawlers and mine-layers,
and what not, all under his direction. He had
submarines, too, double the number of the German.
But with all the German men-of-war in harbour, they
had no targets. Where were they? One did not
ask questions that could not be answered. Waiting,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406">406</a></span>
as the whole British fleet was waiting, for the Germans
to show their heads, while cruisers were abroad
scouting the North Sea.</p>

<p>At the outset of the war the German fleet might
have had one chance in ten of getting a turn of fortune
of its favour by an unexpected stroke of strategy.
This was the danger which Admiral Jellicoe had to
guard against. For in one sense, the Germans had
the tactical offensive by sea as well as by land; theirs
the outward thrust from the centre. They could
choose when to come out of their harbour; when to
strike. The British had to keep watch all the time
and be ready whenever the enemy should come.</p>

<p>Thus, the British Grand Fleet was at sea in the
early part of the war, cruising here and there, begging
for battle. Then it was that they learned how to
avoid the submarines and the mine-fields. Submarines
had played a greater part than expected, because Germany
had chosen a guerrilla naval warfare: to harass,
to wound, to wear down. Doubtless she hoped to
reduce the number of British fighting units by attrition.</p>

<p>Weak England might be in plants for making arms
for an army, but not in ship-building. Here was her
true genius. She was a maritime power; Germany
a land-power. Her part as an ally of France and
Russia being to command the sea, all demands of the
Admiralty for material must take precedence over demands
of the War Office. At the end of the first
year she had increased her fighting power by sea to
a still higher ratio of preponderance over the Germans;
in another year she would increase it further.</p>

<p>Admiral von Tirpitz wanted nothing so much as to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407">407</a></span>
draw the British fleet under the guns of Heligoland
or into a mine-field and submarine trap. But Sir John
Jellicoe refused the bait. When he had completed
his precautions and his organisation to meet all new
conditions, his fleet need not go into the open. His
Dreadnoughts could rest at anchor at a base while
his scouts kept in touch with all that was passing and
his auxiliaries and destroyers fought the submarines.
Without a British Dreadnought having fired a shot
at a German Dreadnought, nowhere on the face of
the seas might a single vessel show the German flag
except by thrusting it above the water for a few minutes.</p>

<p>If von Tirpitz sent his fleet out he, too, might find
himself in a trap of mines and submarines. He was
losing submarines and England was building more.
His naval force rather than Sir John’s was suffering
from attrition. The blockade was complete from Iceland
to the North Sea. While the world knew of the
work of the armies, the care that this task required,
the hardships endured, the enormous expenditure of
energy, were all hidden behind that veil of secrecy
which obviously must be more closely drawn over
naval than over army operations.</p>

<p>From this flagship the campaign was directed. One
would think that many offices and many clerks would
be required. But the offices and the clerks were at
the Admiralty. Here was the execution. In a room
perhaps four feet by six was the wireless focus which
received all the reports and sent all the orders, with
trim bluejackets at the keys. “Go!” and “Come!”
the messages were saying; they wasted no words.
Officers of the staff did their work in narrow space,
yet seemed to have plenty of room. Red tape is inflammable.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408">408</a></span>
There is no more place for it on board a
flagship prepared for action than for unnecessary
woodwork.</p>

<p>At every turn the compression and the concentration
of power were like the guns and the decks cleared
for action in their significant directness of purpose.
The system was planetary in its impressive simplicity,
the more striking as nothing that man has ever made
is more complicated or includes more kinds of machinery
than a battleship. One battleship was one
unit, one chessman on the naval board.</p>

<p>Not all famous leaders are likeable, as every world
traveller knows. They all have the magnetism of
force, which is quite another thing from the magnetism
of charm. What the public demands is that
they shall win victories, whether personally likeable
or not. But if they are likeable and simple and human
in the bargain and a sailor besides&mdash;well, we
know what that means.</p>

<p>Perhaps Sir John Jellicoe is not a great man. It is
not for a civilian even to presume to judge. We have
the word of those who ought to know, however, that
he is. I hope that he is, because I like to think that
great commanders need not necessarily appear formidable.
Nelson refused to be cast for the heavy part,
and so did Farragut. It may be a sailor characteristic.
I predict that after this war is over, whatever
honours or titles they may bestow on him, the English
are going to like Sir John Jellicoe not alone for
his service to the nation, but for himself.</p>

<p>Admiral Jellicoe is one with Captain Jellicoe, whose
cheeriness even when wounded kept up the spirits of
the others on the Relief Expedition of Boxer days.
“He could do it, too!” one thought, having in mind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409">409</a></span>
Sir David Beatty’s leap to the deck of a destroyer.
Spare, of medium height, ruddy, and fifty-seven. So
much for the health qualification which the Admiralty
lords dwelt upon as important. After he had been at
sea for a year he seemed a human machine, much of
the type of that destroyer as a steel machine&mdash;a
thirty-knot human machine, capable of three hundred
or five hundred revolutions, engines running smoothly,
with no waste energy, slipping over the waves and cutting
through them; a quick man, quick of movement,
quick of comprehension and observation, of speech
and of thought, with a delightful self-possession&mdash;for
there are many kinds&mdash;which is instantly responsive
with decision.</p>

<p>A telescope under his arm, too, as he received his
guests. One liked that. He keeps watch over the
fleet himself when he is on the quarter-deck. One
had a feeling that nothing could happen in all his
range of vision, stretching down the “avenues of
Dreadnoughts” to the light-cruiser squadron, and escape
his attention. It hardly seems possible that he
was ever bored. Everything around him interests
him. Energy he has, electric energy in this electric
age, this man chosen to command the greatest war
product of modern energy.</p>

<p>Fastened to the superstructure near the ladder to
his quarters was a new broom which South Africa
had sent him. He was highly pleased with that present;
only the broom was von Tromp’s emblem, while
Blake’s had been the whip. Possibly the South African
Dutchmen, now fighting on England’s side, knew
that he already had the whip and they wanted him to
have the Dutch broom, too.</p>

<p>He had been using both, and many other devices<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410">410</a></span>
in his campaign against von Tirpitz’ “<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">unter see</i>
boots,” which was illustrated by one of the maps hung
in his cabin. Quite different this from maps in a general’s
headquarters, with the front trenches and support
and reserve trenches and gun-positions marked
in vari-coloured pencillings. Instantly a submarine
was sighted anywhere, Sir John had word of it, and
another dot went down on the spot where it had been
seen. In places the sea looked like a pepper-box
cover. Dots were plentiful outside the harbour where
we were; but well outside, like flies around sugar which
they could not reach.</p>

<p>Seeing Sir John among his admirals and guests one
had a glimpse of the life of a sort of mysterious, busy
brotherhood. I was still searching for an admiral
with white hair. If there were none among these
seniors, then all must be on shore. Spirit, I think,
that is the word; the spirit of youth, of corps, of service,
of the sea, of a ready, buoyant definiteness&mdash;yes,
spirit was the word to characterise them. Sir John
moved from one to another in his quick way, asking a
question, listening, giving a direction, his face smiling
and expressive with a sort of infectious confidence.</p>

<p>“He is the man!” said an admiral. I mean, several
admirals and captains said so. They seemed to
like to say it. Whenever he approached one noted
an eagerness, a tightening of nerves. Natural leadership
expresses itself in many ways; Sir John gave it
a sailor’s attractiveness. But I learned that there was
steel under his happy smile; and they liked him for
that, too. Watch out when he is not smiling, and
sometimes when he is smiling, they say.</p>

<p>For failure is never excused in that fleet, as more
than one commander knows. It is a luxury of consideration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411">411</a></span>
which the British nation cannot afford by sea
in time of war. The scene which one witnessed in
the cabin of the Dreadnought flagship could not have
been unlike that of Nelson and his young captains on
the <i>Victory</i>, in the animation of youth governed with
only one thought under the one rule that you must
make good.</p>

<p>Splendid as the sight of the power which Sir John
directed from his quarter-deck while the ships lay still
in their plotted moorings, it paled beside that when
the anchor chains began to rumble and, column by
column, they took on life slowly and majestically gaining
speed one after another turned toward the harbour’s
entrance.</p></div>

<h2 class="vspace"><a id="XXXI"></a>XXXI<br />

<span class="subhead">SIMPLY HARD WORK</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>England’s navy, the culmination of her brains and application&mdash;A
perpetual war-footing&mdash;Pride of craft&mdash;The personnel behind
the guns&mdash;Physique, health, conduct&mdash;Fate’s favourites in the
trenches!&mdash;Gun practice&mdash;A miniature German Navy&mdash;The
acme of efficiency&mdash;The British nation lives or dies with its
navy&mdash;The prototype of our own Atlantic fleet.</p></blockquote>

<p>Besides the simple word spirit, there is the simple
word work. Take the two together, mixing with
them the proper quantity of intelligence, and you have
something finer than Dreadnoughts; for it builds
Dreadnoughts, or tunnels mountains, or wins victories.</p>

<p>In no organisation would it be so easy as in the
navy to become slack. If the public sees a naval review
it knows that its ships can steam and keep their
formations; if it goes on board it knows that the ships
are clean&mdash;at least, the limited part of them which
it sees. And it knows that there are turrets and guns.</p>

<p>But how does it know that the armour of the turrets
is good, or that the guns will fire accurately? Indeed,
all that it sees is the shell. The rest must be
taken on trust. A navy may look all right and be
quite bad. The nation gives a certain amount of
money to build ships which are taken in charge by
officers and men who, shut off from public observation,
may do about as they please.</p>

<p>The result rests with their industry and responsibility.
If they are true to the character of the nation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413">413</a></span>
by and large that is all the nation may expect; if they
are better, then the nation has reason to be grateful,
Englishmen take more interest in their navy than
Americans in theirs. They give it the best that is in
them and they expect the best from it in return.
Every youngster who hopes to be an officer knows
that the navy is no place for idling; every man who
enlists knows that he is in for no junket on a pleasure
yacht. The British navy, I judged, had a relatively
large percentage of the brains and application of
Britain.</p>

<p>“It is not so different from what it was for ten
years before the war,” said one of the officers. “We
did all the work we could stand then; and whether
cruising or lying in harbour, life is almost normal for
us to-day.”</p>

<p>The British fleet was always on a war footing. It
must be. Lack of naval preparation is more dangerous
than lack of land preparation. It is fatal. I
know of officers who had had only a week’s leave in
a year in time of peace; their pay is less than our
officers’. Patriotism kept them up to the mark.</p>

<p>And another thing: Once a sailor, always a sailor,
is an old saying; but it has a new application in modern
navies. They become fascinated with the very
drudgery of ship’s existence. They like their world,
which is their house and their shop. It has the attraction
of a world of priestcraft, with them alone understanding
the ritual. Their drill at the guns becomes
the preparation for the great sport of target practice,
which beats any big game shooting when guns compete
with guns, with battle practice greater sport than
target practice. Bringing a ship into harbour well,
holding her to her place in the formation, roaming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414">414</a></span>
over the seas in a destroyer&mdash;all means eternal effort
at the mastery of material with the results positively
demonstrated.</p>

<p>On one of the Dreadnoughts I saw a gun’s crew
drilling with a dummy six-inch, weight one hundred
pounds.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that boy pretty young to handle that big
shell?” an admiral asked a junior officer.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t think so,” the officer replied. “We
haven’t any one who could handle it better. It would
break his heart if we changed his position.”</p>

<p>Not one of fifty German prisoners whom I had
seen filing by over in France was as sturdy as this
youngster. In the ranks of an infantry company of
any army he would have been above the average of
physique; but among the rest of the gun’s crew he
did appear slight. Need more be said about the physical
standard of the crews of the fighting ships of the
Grand Fleet?</p>

<p>One had an eye to more than guns and machinery
and to more than the character of the officers. He
wanted to become better acquainted with the personnel
of the men behind the guns. They formed patches
of blue on the decks, as one looked around the fleet,
against the background of the dull, painted bulwarks
of steel&mdash;the human element whose skill gave the
ships life&mdash;deep-chested, vigorous men in their prime,
who had the air of men grounded in their work by
long experience. One noted when an order was given
out that it was obeyed quickly by one who knew what
he had to do because he had done it thousands of times.</p>

<p>There are all kinds of bluejackets, as there are all
kinds of other men. Before the war some took more
than was good for them when on shore; some took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415">415</a></span>
nothing stronger than tea; some enjoyed the sailor’s
privilege of growling; some had to be kept up to the
mark sharply; an occasional one might get rebellious
against the merciless repetition of drills.</p>

<p>The war imparted eagerness to all, the officers said.
Infractions of discipline ceased. Days pass without
any one of the crew of a Dreadnought having to be
called up in default, I am told. And their health?
At first thought, one would say that life in the steel
caves of a Dreadnought would mean pasty complexions
and flabby muscles. For a year the crews had been
the prisoners of that readiness which must not lose a
minute in putting to sea if von Tirpitz should ever
try the desperate gamble of battle.</p>

<p>After a turn in the trenches the soldiers can at least
stretch their legs in billets. A certain number of a
ship’s company now and then get a tramp on shore;
not real leave, but a personally conducted outing not
far from the boats which will hurry them back to their
stations on signal. However, all that one needs to
keep well is fresh air and exercise. The blowers
carry fresh air to every part of the ship; the breezes
which sweep the deck from the North Sea are fresh
enough in summer and a little too fresh in winter.
There is exercise in the regular drills, supplemented
by setting-up exercises. The food is good and no
man drinks or eats what he ought not to, as he may
on shore. So there is the fact and the reason for the
fact: the health of the men, as well as their conduct,
had never been so good.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we are not quite so clean as we were
before the war,” said an officer. “We wash decks
only twice a week instead of every day. This means
that quarters are not so moist and the men have more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416">416</a></span>
freedom of movement. We want them to have as
much freedom as possible.”</p>

<p>Waiting, waiting, in such confinement for thirteen
months; waiting for battle! Think of the strain of it!
The British temperament is well fitted to undergo such
a test, and particularly well fitted are these sturdy
seamen of mature years. An enemy may imagine
them wearing down their efficiency on the leash.
They want a fight; naturally, they want nothing quite
so much. But they have the seaman’s philosophy.
Old von Tirpitz may come out and he may not. It
is for him to do the worrying. They sit tight. The
men’s ardour is not imposed upon. Care is taken that
they should not be worked stale; for the marksman
who puts a dozen shots through the bull’s-eye had better
not keep on firing, lest he begin rimming it and
get into bad habits.</p>

<p>Where an army officer has a change when he leaves
the trench for his billet, there is none for the naval
officer, who, unlike the army officer, is Spartan-bred
to confinement. The army pays its daily toll of
casualties; it lies cramped in dugouts, not knowing
what minute extinction may come. The Grand Fleet
has its usual comforts; it is safe from submarines in
a quiet harbour. Many naval officers spoke of this
contrast with deep feeling, as if fate were playing favourites,
though I have never heard an army officer
mention it.</p>

<p>The army can give each day fresh proof of its courage
in face of the enemy. Courage! It takes on a
new meaning with the Grand Fleet. The individual
element of gallantry merges into gallantry of the
whole. You have the very communism of courage.
The thought is to keep a cool head and do your part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417">417</a></span>
as a cog in the vast machine. Courage is as much
taken for granted as the breath of life. Thus, Cradock’s
men, and von Spee’s men, too, fought till they
went down. It was according to the programme laid
out for each turret and each gun in a turret.</p>

<p>Smith, of the army, leads a bomb-throwing party
from traverse to traverse; Smith, of the navy, turns
one lever at the right second. Army gunners are improving
their practice day by day against the enemy;
all the improving by navy gunners must be done before
the battle. No sieges in trenches; no attacks and
counter-attacks: a decision within a few hours&mdash;perhaps
within an hour.</p>

<p>This partially explains the love of the navy for its
work; its cheerful repetition of the drills which seem
such a wearisome business to the civilian. The men
know the reason of their drudgery. It is an all-convincing
bull’s-eye reason. Ping-ping! One heard the
familiar sound of subcalibre practice, which seems as
out of proportion in a fifteen-inch gun as a mouse
squeak from an elephant whom you expect to trumpet.
As the result appears in subcalibre practice, so it is
practically bound to appear in target practice; as it
appears in target practice, so it is bound to appear in
battle practice.</p>

<p>It was on the flagship that I saw a device which Sir
John referred to as the next best thing to having the
Germans come out. He took as much delight in it
as the gun-pointers, who were firing at German
Dreadnoughts of the first line, as large as your thumb,
which were in front of a sort of hooded arrangement
with the guns of a British Dreadnought inside&mdash;the
rest I censor myself before the regular censor sees it.
When we heard a report like that of a small target<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418">418</a></span>
rifle inside the arrangement a small red or a small
white splash rose from the metallic platter of a sea.
Thus the whole German navy has been pounded to
pieces again and again. It is a great game. The
gun-pointers never tire of it and they think they know
the reason as well as anybody why von Tirpitz keeps
his Dreadnoughts at home.</p>

<p>But elsewhere I saw some real firing; for ships must
have their regular target practice, war or no war.
If those cruisers steaming across the range had been
sending six- or eight-inch shrapnel, we should have
preferred not to be so near that towed square of
canvas. Flashes from turrets indistinguishable at a
distance from the neutral-toned bodies of the vessels
and the shells struck, making great splashes just beyond
the target, which was where they ought to go.</p>

<p>A familiar scene, but with a new meaning when
the time is one of war. So far as my observation is
worth anything, it was very good shooting, indeed.
One broadside would have put a destroyer out of
business as easily as a “Jack Johnson” does for a
dugout; and it would have made a cruiser of the same
class as the one firing pretty groggy&mdash;this not from
any experience of being on a light cruiser or any desire
to be on one when it receives such a salute. But it
seems to be waiting for the Germans any time that
they want it.</p>

<p>Oh, that towed square of canvas! It is the symbol
of the object of all building of guns, armour, and ships,
all the nursing in dry dock, all the admiral’s plans, all
the parliamentary appropriations, all the striving on
board ship in man’s competition with man, crew with
crew, gun with gun, and ship with ship. One had in
mind some vast factory plant where every unit was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419">419</a></span>
efficiently organised; but that comparison would not
do. None will. The Grand Fleet is the Grand
Fleet.</p>

<p>Ability gets its reward as in the competition of civil
life. There is no linear promotion indulgent to mediocrity
and inferiority which are satisfied to keep step
and harassing to those whom nature and application
meant to lead. Armchairs and retirement for those
whose inclinations run that way; the captain’s bridge
for those who are fit to command. Officers’ records
are the criterion when superiors come to making promotions.
But does not outside influence play a part?
you ask. If professional conscience is not enough to
prevent this, another thing appears to be: that the
British nation lives or dies with its navy. Besides,
the British public has said to all and sundry outsiders:
“Hands off the navy!” All honour to the British
public, much criticised and often most displeased with
its servants and itself, for keeping its eye on that canvas
square of cloth!</p>

<p>The language on board was the same as on our
ships; the technical phraseology practically the same;
we had inherited British traditions. But a man from
Kansas and a man from Dorset live far apart. If
they have a good deal in common they rarely meet to
learn that they have. But seamen do meet and share
a fraternity which is more than that of the sea. Close
one’s eyes to the difference in uniform, discount the
difference in accent, and one imagined that he might
be with our North Atlantic fleet.</p>

<p>The same sort of shop talk and banter in the wardroom,
which trims and polishes human edges; the
same fellowship of a world apart. Securely ready
the British fleet waits. Enough drill and not too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420">420</a></span>
much; occasional visits between ships; books and newspapers
and a light-hearted relaxation of scattered conversation
in the mess. One wardroom had a thirty-five-second
record for getting past all the pitfalls in
the popular “Silver Bullet” game, if I remember correctly.</p></div>

<span class="subhead">HUNTING THE SUBMARINE</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Seaplanes afloat and on high&mdash;Diabolical bombs&mdash;Sighting a submarine&mdash;The
chase&mdash;Submarine defences&mdash;Torpedo boats at
home&mdash;The mine sweepers&mdash;Patience in the cold of the North
Sea.</p></blockquote>

<p>Seaplanes cut practice circles over the fleet and then
flew away on their errands, to be lost in the sky beyond
the harbour entrance. With their floats, they were
like ducks when they came to rest on the water, sturdy
and a little clumsy looking compared to those hawks
the army planes, soaring to higher altitudes.</p>

<p>The hawk had a broad, level field for its roost; the
duck, bobbing with the waves after it came down, had
its wings folded as became a bird at rest after its
engines stopped and a dead thing, it was lifted on
board its floating home with a crane, as cargo is swung
into the hold.</p>

<p>On shipboard there must be shipshapeness; and that
capacious, one-time popular Atlantic liner had undergone
changes to prepare it for its mothering part, with
platforms in place of the promenades where people
had lounged during the voyage, and bombs in place of
deck quoits and dining-saloons turned into workshops.
Of course, one was shown the different sizes and types
of bombs. Aviators exhibit them with the pride of a
collector showing his porcelains. Every time they
seem to me to have grown larger and more diabolical.
Where will aerial progress end? Will the next war<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422">422</a></span>
be fought by forces that dive and fly like fish and
birds?</p>

<p>“I’d like to drop that hundred-pounder onto a Zeppelin!”
said one of the aviators. All the population
of London would like to see him do it. Also Fritz,
of the submarine, does not like to see the shadow of
man’s wings above the water.</p>

<p>Seaplanes and destroyers carry the imagination
away from the fleet to another sphere of activity,
which I had not the fortune to see. An aviator can
see Fritz below a smooth surface; for he cannot travel
much deeper than thirty or forty feet. He leaves a
characteristic ripple and tell-tale bubbles of air and
streaks of oil. When the planes have located him
they can tell the hunters where to go. Sometimes it
is known that a submarine is in a certain region; he is
lost sight of and seen again; a squall may cover his
track a second time, and the hunters, keeping touch
with the planes by signals, course here and there on
the lookout for another glimpse. Perhaps he escapes
altogether. It is a tireless game of hide-and-seek, like
that of gunnery at the front. Naval ingenuity has
invented no end of methods and no end of experiments
have been tried. Strictest kept of naval secrets, these.
Fritz is not to be told what to avoid and what not to
avoid.</p>

<p>Very thin the skin of a submarine; very fragile and
complicated its machinery. It does not take much of
a shock to put it out of order or a large cargo of explosive
to dent that skin beyond repair. It being in the
nature of submarines to sink, how does the hunter
know when he has struck a mortal blow? If oil and
bubbles come up for sometime in one place, or if they
come up with a rush, that is suggestive. Then, it does<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423">423</a></span>
not require a nautical mind to realise that by casting
about on the bottom with a grapnel you will learn if
an object with the bulk and size of a submarine is
there. Admirals accept no guesswork from the hunters
about their exploits; they must bring the brush to
prove the kill.</p>

<p>With Admiral Crawford I went to see the submarine
defences of a harbour. It reminded one of
the old days of the drawbridge to the castle, when a
friend rode freely in and an enemy might try to swim
the moat and scale the walls if he pleased.</p>

<p>“Take care! There is a tide here!” the coxswain
was warned, lest the barge get into some of the
troubles meant for Fritz. “A cunning fellow, Fritz.
We must give him no openings.”</p>

<p>The openings appear long enough to permit British
craft, whether trawlers, or flotillas, or cruisers, or battleships,
to go and come. Lying as close together as
fish in a basket, I saw at one place a number of torpedo
boats home from a week at sea.</p>

<p>“Here to-day and gone to-morrow,” said an officer.
“What a time they had last winter! You know how
cold the North Sea is&mdash;no, you cannot, unless you
have been out in a torpedo boat dancing the tango in
the teeth of that bitter wind, with the spray whipping
up to the tops of the smoke-stacks. In the dead of
night they would come into this pitch-dark harbour.
How they found their way is past me. It’s a trick of
those young fellows, who command.”</p>

<p>Stationary they seemed now as the quay itself; but
let a signal speak, an alarm come, and they would soon
be as alive as leaping porpoises. The sport is to those
who scout and hunt. But, again, do not forget those
who watch, those who keep the blockade, from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424">424</a></span>
Channel to Iceland, and those trawlers who plod over
plotted sea-squares with the regularity of mowing
machines cutting a harvest, on their way back and forth
sweeping up mines. They were fishermen before the
war and are fishermen still. Night and day they keep
at it. They come into the harbours stiff with cold,
thaw out, and return to hardships which would make
many a man prefer the trenches. Tributes to their
patient courage, which came from the heart, were
heard on board the battleships.</p>

<p>“It is when we think of them,” said an officer,
“that we are most eager to have the German fleet
come out, so that we can do our part.”</p></div>

<span class="subhead">THE FLEET PUTS TO SEA</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The test of perfect motion&mdash;Is the fleet bottled by submarines?&mdash;The
message arrives&mdash;The sea-march of dull-toned unadorned
power&mdash;Destroyers in the van&mdash;The majestic procession of
battleships&mdash;The secret in sheer hard work&mdash;The sea-lion on

Zeppelin’s pitiable target&mdash;Meaning of British dominion&mdash;A
German comparison.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is another test besides that of gun drills and
target practice which reflects the efficiency of individual
ships, and the larger the number of ships the
more important it is. For the business of a fleet is
to go to sea. At anchor it is in garrison rather than
on campaign, an assembly of floating forts. Navies
one has seen which seemed excellent when in harbour,
but when they started to get under way the result was
hardly reassuring. Some erring sister fouled her
anchor chain; another had engine room trouble;
another lagged for some other reason; there was
fidgeting on the bridges. Then one asked, What if
a summons to battle had come?</p>

<p>Our own officers were authority enough for me that
the British had no superiors in any of the tests. But
strange reports dodged in and out of the alleys of
pessimism in the company of German insistence that
the <i>Tiger</i> and other ships which one saw afloat had
been sunk. Was the fleet really held prisoner by fear
of submarines? If it could go and come freely when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426">426</a></span>
it chose, the harbour was the place for it while it
waited. If not, then, indeed, the submarine had revolutionised
naval warfare. Admiral Jellicoe might
lose some of his battleships before he could ever go
into action against von Tirpitz.</p>

<p>“Oh, to hear the hoarse rattle of the anchor
chains!” I kept thinking while I was with the fleet.
“Oh, to see all those monsters on the move!”</p>

<p>A vain wish it seemed, but it came true. A message
from the Admiralty arrived while we were on the
flagship. Admiral Jellicoe called his flag secretary,
spoke a word to him, which was passed in a twinkling
from flagship to squadron and division and ship. He
made it as simple as ordering his barge alongside, this
sending of the Grand Fleet to sea.</p>

<p>From the bridge of a destroyer beyond the harbour
entrance we saw it go. I shall not attempt to describe
the spectacle, which convinced me that language is the
vehicle for making small things seem great and great
things seem small. If you wish words invite splendid
and magnificent and overwhelming and all the reliable
old friends to come forth in glad apparel from the dictionary.
Personally, I was inarticulate at sight of that
sea march of dull-toned, unadorned power.</p>

<p>First came the outriders of majesty, the destroyers;
then the graceful light cruisers. How many destroyers
has the British navy? I am only certain that it
has not as many as it seems to have, which would mean
thousands. Trying to count them is like trying to
count the bees in the garden. You cannot keep your
eye on the individual bees. You are bound to count
some twice, so busy are their manœuvres.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry, great ladies!” one imagined the
destroyers were saying to the battleships. “We will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427">427</a></span>
clear the road. We will keep watch against snipers
and assassins.”</p>

<p>“And if any knocks are coming, we will take them
for you, great ladies!” said the cruisers. “If one of
us went down, the loss would not be great. Keep
your big guns safe to beat other battleships into scrap.”</p>

<p>For you may be sure that Fritz was on the watch in
the open. He always is, like the highwayman hiding
behind a hedge and envying people who have comfortable
beds. Probably from a distance he had a
peek through his periscope at the Grand Fleet before
the approach of the policeman destroyers made him
duck beneath the water; and probably he tried to count
the number of ships and identify their classes in order
to take the information home to Kiel. Besides, he
always has his fingers crossed. He hopes that some
day he may get a shot at something more warlike than
a merchant steamer or an auxiliary; only that prospect
becomes poorer as life for him grows harder. Except
a miracle happened, the steaming fleet, with its cordons
of destroyers, is as safe from him as from any other
kind of fish.</p>

<p>The harbour which is the fleet’s home is landlocked
by low hills. There is an eclipse of the sun by the
smoke from the ships getting under way; streaming,
soaring columns of smoke on the move rise above the
skyline from the funnels of the battleships before they
appear in sight around a bend. Indefinite masses as
yet they are, under their night-black plumes. Each
ship seems too immense to respond to any will except
its own. There is something automatic in the regularity
with which, one after another, they take the
bend, as if a stop watch had been held on twenty
thousand tons of steel for a second’s variation. As<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428">428</a></span>
they approach they become more distinct and, showing
less smoke, there seems less effort. Their motive-power
seems inherent, perpetual.</p>

<p>There is some sea running outside the entrance,
enough to make a destroyer roll. But the battleships
disdain any notice of its existence. It is no more to
them than a ripple of dust to a motor truck. They
plough through it.</p>

<p>Though you were within twenty yards of them you
would feel quite safe. An express train was in no
more danger of jumping the track. Mast in line with
mast, they held the course with a majestic steadiness.
Now the leading ship makes a turn of a few points.
At the same spot, as if it were marked by the grooves
of tires in a road, the others make it. Any variation
of speed between them would have been instantly noticeable,
as one forged ahead or lagged; but the distance
between bows and sterns did not change. A line
of one length would do for each interval so far as one
could discern. It was difficult to think that they were
not attached to some taut moving cable under water.
How could such apparently unwieldy monsters, in such
a slippery element as the sea, be made to obey their
masters with such fine precision?</p>

<p>The answer again is sheer hard work! Drills as
arduous in the engine room as at the guns; machinery
kept in tune; traditions in manœuvring in all weathers,
which are kept up with tireless practice.</p>

<p>Though all seemed perfection to the lay eye, let it
be repeated that this was not so to the eyes of admirals.
It never can be. Perfection is the thing striven for.
Officers dwell on faults; all are critics. Thus you have
the healthiest kind of spirit, which means that there
will be no cessation in the striving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429">429</a></span>
“Look at that!” exclaimed an officer on the destroyer.
“They better try another painting on her
and see if they can’t do better.”</p>

<p>Ever changing that northern light. For an instant
the sun’s rays, strained by a patch of peculiar cloud,
playing on a Dreadnought’s side made her colour
appear molten, exaggerating her size till she seemed as
colossal to the eye as to the thought.</p>

<p>“But look, now!” said another officer. She was
out of the patch and seemed miles farther away to the
vision, a dim shape in the sea-haze.</p>

<p>“You can’t have it right for every atmospheric
mood of the North Sea, I suppose!” muttered the
critic. Still, it hurt his professional pride that a battleship
should show up as such a glaring target even for
a moment.</p>

<p>The power of the fleet was more patent in movement
than at rest; for the sea-lion was out of his lair
on the hunt. Fluttering with flags at a review at Spithead
the battleships seemed out of their element;
giants trying for a fairy’s part. Display is not for
them. It ill becomes them, as a pink ribbon on a bulldog.
Irresistibly ploughing their way they presented
a picture of resolute utility&mdash;guns and turrets and
speed. No spot of bright colour was visible on board.
The crew was at the guns, I took it. Turn the turrets,
give the range, lay the sights on the enemy’s ships, and
the battle was on.</p>

<p>“There is the old Dreadnought,” said an officer.</p>

<p>The <em>old</em> Dreadnought&mdash;all of ten years of age, the
senile old thing! What a mystery she was when she
was building! The mystery accentuated her celebrity&mdash;and
almost forgotten now, while the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>
and the <i>Warspite</i> and others of their class with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430">430</a></span>
their fifteen-inch guns would be in the public eye as the
latest type till a new type came. A parade of naval
types was passing. One seemed to shade into the
other in harmonious effect.</p>

<p>But here was an outsider, whom one noted instantly
as he studied those rugged silhouettes of steel and
counted guns. She had been a Turk. As the Turks
were going to have only one battleship, they were not
bothered about squadron homogeneity. They piled
turret on turret, twelve twelve-inch guns in exotic
array. She was finished and the Turks were already
on board to take her home when the war began. But
British law requires that any foreign man-of-war
building in English shipyards may be taken over for
her cost in case of war. So England kept the ship,
which the Turks, I understand, thought was hardly a
sporting thing to do.</p>

<p>One division, two divisions, four ships, eight Dreadnoughts&mdash;even
a squadron coming out of a harbour
numbs the faculties with a sense of its might. Sixteen&mdash;twenty&mdash;twenty-four&mdash;it
was the unending numbers
of this procession of sea-power which was most
impressive. An hour passed and all were not by.
One sat down for a few minutes behind the wind screen
of the destroyer’s bridge, only to look back and see
more Dreadnoughts going by. One had not realised
that there were so many in the harbour. He had a
suspicion that Admiral Jellicoe was a conjuror who
could take Dreadnoughts out of a hat.</p>

<p>The first was lost in the gathering darkness far out
in the North Sea, and still the cloud of smoke over the
anchorage was as thick as ever; still the black plumes
kept appearing around the bend. The King Edward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431">431</a></span>
VII class with their four twelve-inch guns and other
ancients of the pre-Dreadnought era, which are still
powerful antagonists, were yet to come. One’s eyes
ached. Those who saw a German corps march
through Brussels said that it seemed irresistible.
What if they had seen the whole German army?
Here was the counterpart of the whole German army
in sea-power and in land-power, too.</p>

<p>The destroyer commander looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“Time!” he said. “I’ll put you on shore.”</p>

<p>He must take his place in the fleet at a given moment.
A word to the engine room and the next thing
we knew we were off at thirty knots an hour, cutting
straight across the bows of a Dreadnought steaming at
twenty knots towering over us threateningly, with a
bone in her teeth.</p>

<p>One’s imagination sped across seas where he had
cruised into harbours that he knew and across continents
that he knew. He was trying to visualise the
whole globe&mdash;all of it except the Baltic seas and a
thumbmark in the centre of Europe. Hong Kong,
Melbourne, Sydney, Halifax, Cape Town, Bombay&mdash;yes,
and Rio and Valparaiso, Shanghai, San Francisco,
New York, Boston, these and the lands back of them
where countless millions dwell were all safe behind the
barrier of that fleet.</p>

<p>Then back through the land where Shakespeare
wrote to London, with its glare of recruiting posters
and the throbbing of that individual freedom which is
on trial in battle with the Prussian system&mdash;and as
one is going to bed the sound of guns in the heart of
the city! From the window one looked upward to
see, under a searchlight’s play, the silken sheen of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432">432</a></span>
cigar-shaped sort of aerial phantom which was dropping
bombs on women and children, while never a shot
was fired at those sturdy men behind armour.</p>

<p>When you have travelled far; when you think of
Botha and his Boers fighting for England; when you
have found justice and fair play and open markets
under the British flag; when you compare the vociferations
of von Tirpitz glorying in the torpedoing of a
<i>Lusitania</i> with the quiet manner of Sir John Jellicoe,
you need only a little spark of conscience to prefer the
way that the British have used their sea-power to the
way that the men who send out Zeppelins to war on
women and children would use that power if they had
it.</p></div>

<p>A single incident, an impression photographic in its
swiftness, a chance remark, may be more illuminating
than a day’s experiences. One does not need to go to
the front for them. Sometimes they come to the gateway
of our château. They are pages at random out
of a library of overwhelming information.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>One of the aviation grounds is not far away. Look
skyward at almost any hour of the day and you will see
a plane, its propeller a roar or a hum according to its
altitude. Sometimes it is circling in practice; again,
it is off to the front. At break of day the planes
appear; in the gloaming they return to roost.</p>

<p>If an aviator has leave for two or three days in
summer he starts in the late afternoon, flashing over
that streak of Channel in half an hour and may be at
home for dinner without getting any dust on his clothes
or having to bother with military red tape at steamer
gangways or customs houses.</p>

<p>The airmen are a type, with certain marked characteristics.
No nervous man is wanted, and it is time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434">434</a></span>
for an aviator to take a rest at the first sign of nerves.
They seem shy and diffident, men of the kind given to
observation rather than to talking; men accustomed to
using their eyes and hands. It is difficult to realise
that some quiet young fellow, who is pointed out, has
had so many hairbreadth escapes. What tales,
worthy of Arabian Nights’ heroes who are borne away
on magic carpets, they bring home, relating them as
matter-of-factly as if they had broken a shoelace.</p>

<p>Up in their seats, a whir of the motor, and they are
off on another adventure. They shy at mention of
their names in print, for that is not good for the spirit
of corps of this newest branch in the service of war.
Anonymity is absolute. Everything is done by the
corps for the corps. Possibly because it is so young,
because it started with chosen men, the British Aviation
Corps is unsurpassed; but partly it is because of
the British temperament, with that combination of
coolness and innate love of risk which the British manner
sometimes belies.</p>

<p>Something of the old spirit of knighthood characterises
air service. It is individual work; its numbers
are relatively few. I like one of the aviation customs,
not for its chivalry alone, but because it makes one feel
more kindly toward the Germans. If a German aviator
has to descend in the British lines, whether from
motor trouble or because he is winged by an anti-aircraft
gun, a British aviator flies over the German
lines and drops a “message-bag” with long streamers
telling whether the unfortunate one is dead or alive,
and the Germans do the same.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Some mornings ago I saw several young soldiers
with notebooks going about our village street. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435">435</a></span>
were from the cadet school where privates, from the
trenches, take a course and return with chocolate drops
on their sleeve-bands as commissioned officers. This
was a course in billeting. For ours is not an army in
tents, but one living in French houses and barns. The
pupils were learning how to carry out this delicate
task; for delicate it is. A stranger speaking another
language becomes the guest of the host for whom he is
fighting. Mr. Atkins receives only shelter; he supplies
his own meals. His excess of marmalade one
sees yellowing the cheeks of the children in the family
where he is at home. Madame objects only to his
efforts to cook in her kitchen; womanlike, she would
rather handle the pots and pans herself.</p>

<p>Tommy is thoroughly instructed in his duty as guest
and under a discipline that is merciless so far as conduct
toward the population goes; so the two get on
better than French and English military authorities
feared that they might. Time has taught them to
understand each other and see that difference in race
does not mean absence of human qualities in common,
though differently expressed. Many armies I have
seen, but never one better behaved than the British
army in France and Flanders in its respect for property
and the rights of the population.</p>

<p>And while the fledgling officers are going on with
their billeting, we hear the t-r-r-t of a machine gun at
a machine-gun school about a mile distant, where
picked men also from the trenches receive instruction
in the use of an arm new to them. There are other
schools within sound of the guns teaching the art of
war to an expanding army in the midst of war, with the
teachers bringing their experience from the battle-line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436">436</a></span></p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>“Their shops and their houses all have fronts of
glass,” wrote a Sikh soldier home, “and even the poor
are rich in this bountiful land.”</p>

<p>Sikhs and Ghurkas and Rajputs and Pathans and
Gherwalis, the brown-skinned tribesmen in India, have
been on a strange Odyssey, bringing picturesqueness
to the khaki tone of modern war. Aeroplanes interested
them less than a trotting dog in a wheel for
drawing water. They would watch that for hours.</p>

<p>Still fresh in mind is a scene when the air seemed a
moist sponge and all above the earth was dripping and
all under foot a mire. I was homesick for the flash on
the windows of the New York skyscrapers or the
gleam on the Hudson of that bright sunlight in a drier
air, that is the secret of the American’s nervous energy.
It seemed to me that it was enough to have to exist in
Northern France at that season of the year, let alone
fighting Germans.</p>

<p>Out of the drizzly, misty rain along a muddy road
and turning past us came the Indian cavalry, which,
like the British cavalry, had fought on foot in the
trenches, while their horses led the leisurely life of true
equine gentry. Erect in their saddles, their martial
spirit defiant of the weather, their black eyes flashing
as they looked toward the reviewing officers, troop
after troop of these sons of the East passed by, every
one seeming as fit for review as if he had cleaned his
uniform and equipment in his home barracks instead
of in French barns.</p>

<p>One asked who had trained them; who had fashioned
the brown clay into resolute and loyal obedience
which stood the test of a Flanders winter? What was
the force which could win them to cross the seas to
fight for England? Among the brown faces topped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437">437</a></span>
with turbans appeared occasional white faces. These
were the men; these the force.</p>

<p>The marvel was not that the Indians were able to
fight as well as they did in that climate, but that they
fought at all. What welcome summer brought from
their gleaming black eyes! July or August could not
be too hot for them. On a plateau one afternoon I
saw them having a <em>gymkana</em>. It was a treat for the
King of the Belgians, who has had few holidays, indeed,
this last year, and for the French peasants who
came from the neighbourhood. Yelling, wild as they
were in tribal days before the British brought order
and peace to India, the horsemen galloped across the
open space, picking up handkerchiefs from the ground
and impaling tent pegs on their lances. The French
peasants clapped their hands and the British Indian
officers said, “Good!” when the performer succeeded,
or, “Too bad!” when he failed.</p>

<p>If you asked the officers for the secret of the Indian
Empire they said: “We try to be fair to the natives!”
which means that they are just and even-tempered.
An enormous, loose-jointed machine the British
Empire, which seems sometimes to creak a bit but
yet holds together for that very reason. Imperial
weight may have interfered with British adaptability
to the kind of warfare which was the one kind that the
Germans had to train for; but certainly some Englishmen
must know how to rule.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>That church bell across the street from our château
begins its clangour at dawn, summoning the French
women and children and the old men to the fields in
harvest time. But its peals carrying across the farmlands
are softened by distance and sweet to the tired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438">438</a></span>
workers in the evening. In the morning its peal in
their ears tells them that the day is long and they have
much to do before dark. After that thought I never
complained because it robbed me of my sleep. I felt
ashamed not to be up and doing myself, and worked
with a better spirit.</p>

<p>“Will they do it?”</p>

<p>We asked this question as often in our mess in those
August days as, Will the Russians lose Warsaw?
Would the peasants be able to get in their crops, with
all the able-bodied men away? I had inside information
from the village mayor and the blacksmith and the
baker that they would. A financial expert, the baker.
Of course, he said that France would go on fighting till
the German was beaten, just as the old men and the
women and children said, whether the church bell was
clanging the matins or the angelus. But there was
the question of finances. It took money to fight.
The Americans, he knew, had more money than they
knew what to do with&mdash;as Europeans universally
think, only, personally, I find that I was overlooked in
the distribution&mdash;and if they would loan the Allies
some of their spare billions, Germany was surely
beaten.</p>

<p>A busy man the blacksmith, and brawny, if he had
no spreading chestnut tree; busy not only shoeing
farmhorses, but repairing American reapers and binders,
whose owners profited exceedingly and saved the
day. But not all farmers felt that they could afford
the charge. These kept at their small patches with
sickles. Gradually the carpets of gold waving in the
breeze became bundles lying on the stubble, and great
conical harvest stacks rose, while children gathered
the stray stems left on the ground by the reapers till<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439">439</a></span>
they had immense bouquets of wheat-heads under their
arms, enough to make two or three loaves of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pain
de ménage</i> that the baker sold. So the peasants did
it; they won; and this was some compensation for the
loss of Warsaw.</p>

<p>One morning we heard troops marching past, which
was not unusual. But these were French troops in
the British zone, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en route</i> from somewhere in France
to somewhere else in France. There was not a person
left in any house in that village. Everybody was out,
with affection glowing in their eyes. For these were
their own&mdash;their soldiers of France.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>When you see a certain big limousine flying a small
British flag pass you know that it belongs to the Commander-in-Chief;
and though it may be occupied only
by one of his aides, often you will have a glimpse of
a man with a square chin and a drooping white
moustache, who is the sole one among the hundreds of
thousands at the British front who wears the crossed
batons of a field marshal.</p>

<p>It is erroneous to think that Sir John French or any
other commander, though that is the case in time of
action, spends all his time in the private house occupied
as headquarters, designated by two wisps of flags,
studying a map and sending and receiving messages,
when the trench line remains stationary. He goes
here and there on inspections. It is the only way that
a modern leader may let his officers and men know
that he is a being of flesh and blood and not a name
signed to reports and orders. A machine-gun company
I knew had a surprise when resting in a field
waiting for orders. They suddenly recognised in a
figure coming through an opening in a hedge the supreme<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440">440</a></span>
head of the army in France. There was no
need of a call to attention. The effect was like an
electric shock, which sent every man to his place and
made his backbone a steel rod. Those crossed batons
represented a dizzy altitude to that battery which
had just come out from England. Sir John walked
up and down, looking over men and guns after their
nine months’ drill at home, and said, “Very good!”
and was away to other inspections where he might not
necessarily say, “Very good!”</p>

<p>Frequently his inspections are formal. A battalion
or a brigade is drawn up in a field, or they march past.
Then he usually makes a short speech. On one occasion
the officers had arranged a platform for the
speech-making. Sir John gave it a glance and that
was enough. It was the end of such platforms erected
for him.</p>

<p>“Inspections! They are second nature to us!”
said a new army man. “We were inspected and inspected
at home and we are inspected and inspected
out here. If there is anything wrong with us it is the
general’s own fault if it isn’t found out. When a
general is not inspecting, some man from the medical
corps is disinfecting.”</p>

<p>Battalions of the new army are frequently billeted
for two or three days in our village. The barn up the
road I know is capable of housing twenty men and one
officer; for this is chalked on the door. Before they
turn in for the night the men frequently sing, and the
sound of their voices is pleasant.</p>

<p>A typical inspection was one that I saw in the main
street. The battalion was drawn up in full marching
equipment on the road. Of those officers with packs
on their backs one was only nineteen. This is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441">441</a></span>
limit of youth to acquire a chocolate drop on its arm.
The sergeant major was an old regular, the knowing
backbone of the battalion, which had taken the men of
clay and taught them their letters and then how to spell
and to add and subtract and divide. One of those impressive
red caps arrived in a car, and the general who
wore it went slowly up and down the line, front and
rear, examining rifles and equipment, while the young
officers and the old sergeant were hoping that Jones or
Smith hadn’t got some dust in his rifle-barrel at the last
moment.</p>

<p>Brokers and carpenters, bankers and mechanics,
clerks and labourers, the new army is like the army of
France, composed of all classes. One evening I had a
chat with two young fellows in a battalion quartered
in the village, who were seated beside the road. Both
came from Buckinghamshire. One was a schoolmaster
and the other an architect. They were “bunkies,”
pals, chums.</p>

<p>“When did you enlist?” I asked.</p>

<p>“In early September, after the Marne retreat.
We thought that it was our duty, then. But we’ve
been a long time arriving.”</p>

<p>“How do you like it?”</p>

<p>“We are not yet masters of the language, we find,”
said the schoolmaster, “though I had a pretty good
book knowledge of it.”</p>

<p>“I’m learning the gestures fast, though,” said the
architect.</p>

<p>“The French are glad to see us,” said the schoolmaster.
“They call us the Keetcheenaires. I fancy
they thought we were a long time coming. But now
we are here, I think they will find that we can hold up
our end.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442">442</a></span>
They had the fresh complexions which come from
healthy, outdoor work. There was something engaging
in their boyishness and their views. For they
had a wider range of interests than that professional
soldier, Mr. Atkins, these citizens who had taken up
arms. They knew what trench-fighting meant by
work in practice trenches at home.</p>

<p>“Of course it will not be quite the same; theory and
practice never are,” said the schoolmaster.</p>

<p>“We ought to be well-grounded in the principles,”
said the architect&mdash;imagine the average Mr. Atkins
talking in such language!&mdash;“and they say that in a
week or two of actual experience you will have mastered
the details that could not be taught in England.
Then, too, having shells burst around you will be
strange at first. But I think our battalion will give a
good account of itself, sir. All the Bucks men have!”
There crept in the pride of regiment, of locality, which
is so characteristically Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p>They change life at the front, these new army men.
If a carpenter, a lawyer, a sign-painter, an accountant,
is wanted, you have only to speak to a new army battalion
commander and one is forthcoming&mdash;a millionaire,
too, for that matter, who gets his shilling a day
for serving his country. Their intelligence permitted
the architect and the schoolmaster to have no illusions
about the character of the war they had to face. The
pity was that such a fine force as the new army, which
had not become trench stale, could not have a free
space in which to make a great turning movement, instead
of having to go against that solid battle-front
from Switzerland to the North Sea.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>We have heard enough&mdash;quite enough for most of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443">443</a></span>
us&mdash;about the German Crown Prince. But there is
also a prince with the British army in France. No
lieutenant looks younger for his years than this one in
the Grenadier Guards, and he seems of the same
type as the others when you see him marching with
his regiment or off for a walk smoking a briar-wood
pipe. There are some officers who would rather not
accompany him on his walks, for he can go fast and
far. He makes regular reports of his observations,
and he has opportunities for learning which other subalterns
lack, for he may have both the staff and the
army as personal instructors. Otherwise, his life is
that of any other subaltern; for there is an instrument
called the British Constitution which regulates many
things. A little shy, very desirous to learn, is Albert
Edward, Prince of Wales, heir to the throne of Great
Britain and Ireland and the Empire of India. He
might be called the willing prince.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>This was one of the shells that hit&mdash;one of the
hundred that hit. The time was summer; the place,
the La Bassée region. Probably the fighting was all
the harder here because it is so largely blind. When
you cannot see what an enemy is doing you keep on
pumping shells into the area which he occupies; you
take no risks with him.</p>

<p>The visitor may see about as much of what is going
on in the La Bassée region as an ant can see of the
surrounding landscape when promenading in the grass.
The only variation in the flatness of the land is the
overworked ditches which try to drain it. Look upward
and rows of poplar trees along the level and a
hedge, a grove, a cottage, or trees and shrubs around
it, limit your vision. Thus, if a breeze starts timidly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444">444</a></span>
in a field it is stopped before it goes far. That “hot
corner” is all the hotter for a burning July sun. The
army water-carts which run back to wells of cool water
are busy filling empty canteens, while shrapnel trims
the hedges.</p>

<p>A stretcher was being borne into the doorway of an
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">estaminet</i> which had escaped destruction by shells, and
above the door was chalked some lettering which indicated
that it was a first clearing station for the
wounded. Lying on other stretchers on the floor were
some wounded men. Of the two nearest, one had a
bandage around his head and one a bandage around
his arm. They had been stunned, which was only
natural when you have been as close as they had to a
shell-burst&mdash;a shell that made a hit. The concussion
was bound to have this effect.</p>

<p>A third man was the best illustration of shell destructiveness.
Bullets make only holes. Shells make
gouges, fractures, pulp. He, too, had a bandaged
head and had been hit in several places; but the
worst wound was in the leg, where an artery had been
cut. He was weak, with a sort of where-am-I look
in his eyes. If the fragment which had hit his leg
had hit his head, or his neck, or his abdomen, he would
have been killed instantly. He was an illustration of
how hard it is to kill a man even with several shell-fragments,
unless some of them strike in the right
place. For he was going to live; the surgeon had
whispered the fact in his ear, that one important fact.
He had beaten the German shell, after all.</p>

<p>Returning by the same road by which we came a motor
car ran swiftly by, the only kind of car allowed on
that road. We had a glimpse of the big painted red
cross on an ambulance side, and at the rear, where the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445">445</a></span>
curtains were rolled up for ventilation, of four pairs
of soldier boot-soles at the end of four stretchers,
which had been slid into place at the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">estaminet</i> by the
sturdy, kindly, experienced medical corps men.</p>

<p>Only one ambulance, dust-covered, of the colour of
the road itself came along, clear of any blast of shells;
nothing at the front sends the same chill down the
spine as the thought of a man wounded by a shell being
hit a second time by a shell. It rarely happens, so
prompt and so shrewd is the work of the Royal Army
Medical Corps.</p>

<p>Before we reached the village the ambulance
passed us on the way back to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">estaminet</i>. Very
soon after the shell-burst, a telephone bell had rung
down the line from the extreme front calling for an
ambulance and stating the number of men hit, so that
everybody would know what to prepare for. At the
village, which was outside the immediate danger zone,
was another clearing station. Here the stretchers
were taken into a house&mdash;taken without a jolt by men
who were specialists in handling stretchers&mdash;for any
redressing if necessary, before another ambulance
started them on a journey, with motor trucks and staff
automobiles giving right of way, to a spotless white
hospital ship which would take them home to England
the next night.</p>

<p>It had been an incident of life at the front and of
the organisation of war, causing less flurry than an
ambulance call to an accident in a great city.</p></div>

<p>Throughout the summer of 1915 the world was
asking, What about the new British army? Why was
it not attacking at the opportune moment when Germany
was throwing her weight against Russia? A
facile answer is easy; indeed, facile answers are always
easy. Unhappily, they are rarely correct.
None that was given in this instance was, to my mind.
They sought to put a finger on one definite cause;
again, on an individual or a set of individuals.</p>

<p>The reasons were manifold; as old as Waterloo, as
fresh as the last speech in Parliament. They were
inherent in the Anglo-Saxon race. Whoever raised
a voice and said, This, or that, or you, are responsible!
should first have looked into his own mind and into
the history of his race and then into a mirror. Least
of all should any American have been puzzled by
the delay.</p>

<p>“Oh, we should have done better than that&mdash;we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447">447</a></span>
are Americans!” I hear my countrymen say. Perhaps
we should. I hope so; I believe so. The
British public thought that they were going to do better;
military men were surprised that they did as well.</p>

<p>Along with laws and language we have inherited
our military ideas from England. In many qualities
we are different&mdash;a distinct type; but in nothing are
we more like the British than in our attitude toward
the soldier and toward war. The character of any
army reflects the character of its people. An army is
the fist; but the muscle, the strength of the physical
organism behind the blow in the long run belong to
the people. What they have prepared for in peace
they receive in war, which decides whether they have
been living in the paradise of a fool or of a wise man.</p>

<p>As a boy I was brought up to believe, as an inheritance
of the American Revolution, that one American
could whip two Englishmen and five or six of any
other nationality, which made the feathers of the eagle
perched on the national escutcheon look glossy. It
was a satisfying sort of faith. Americans had never
tried five or six of any first-class fighting race; but that
was not a thought which occurred to me. As we had
won victories over the English and the English had
whipped the French at Waterloo, the conclusion
seemed obvious.</p>

<p>English boys, I understand, also had been brought
up to believe that one Englishman could whip five or
six men of any other nationality, but, I take it for
granted, only two Americans. This clothed the
British lion with majesty, while the lower ratio of superiority
over Americans returned the compliment in
kind from the sons of the lion to the sons of the
eagle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448">448</a></span>
After I began to read history for myself and to
think as I read, I found that when British and Americans
had met, the generals on either side were solicitous
about having superior forces, and in case of odds
of two to one they made a “strategic retreat.”
When either side was beaten, the other always explained
that he was overcome by superior numbers,
though perhaps the adversary had not more than ten
or fifteen per cent. advantage. Then I learned that
the British had not whipped five or six times their
numbers on the Continent of Europe. The British
Expeditionary Force made as fine an effort to do so
at Mons as was ever attempted in history, but they
did not succeed.</p>

<p>It was a regular army that fought at Mons. The
only two first-class nations which depend upon regulars
to do their fighting are the British and the American.
This is the vital point of similarity which is
the practical manifestation of our military ideas. We
have been the earth’s spoiled children, thanks to the
salt seas between us and other powerful military nations.
Before any other power could reach the
United States it must overwhelm the British navy,
and then it must overwhelm ours and bring its forces
in transports. Sea-power, you say. That is the
facile word, so ready to the lips that we do not realise
the wonder of it any more than of the sun rising and
setting.</p>

<p>When we want soldiers our plan still is to advertise
for them. The ways of our ancestors remain ours.
We think that the volunteer must necessarily make
the best soldier because he offers his services; while
the conscript&mdash;rather a term of opprobrium to us&mdash;must
be lukewarm. It hardly occurs to us that some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449">449</a></span>
forms of persuasion may amount to conscription, or
that the volunteer, won by oratorical appeal to his
emotions or by social pressure, may suffer a reaction
after enlistment which will make him lukewarm also,
particularly as he sees others, also young and fit, hanging
back. Nor does it occur to us that there may be
virtue in that fervour of national patriotism aroused by
the command that all must serve, which on the Continent
in this war, has meant universal exaltation to
sacrifice. The life of Jones means as much to him as
the life of Smith does to him; and when the whole
nation is called to arms there ought to be no favourites
in life-giving.</p>

<p>For the last hundred years, if we except the American
Civil War, ours have been comparatively little
wars. The British regular army has policed an empire
and sent punitive expeditions against rebellious
tribes with paucity of numbers, in a work which the
British so well understand. Our little regular army
took care of the Red Indians as our frontier advanced
from the Alleghenies to the Pacific. To put it bluntly,
we have hired some one to do our fighting for us.</p>

<p>Without ever seriously studying the business of soldiering,
the average Anglo-Saxon thought of himself
as a potential soldier, taking his sense of martial superiority
largely from the work of the long-service,
severely drilled regular. Also, we used our fists
rather than daggers or duelling swords in personal encounters
and, man to man, unequipped with fire-arms
or blades, the quality which is responsible for our
sturdy pioneering individualism gave us confidence in
our physical prowess.</p>

<p>Alas! modern wars are not fought with fists. A
knock-kneed man who knows how to use a machine gun<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450">450</a></span>
and has one to use&mdash;which is also quite important&mdash;could
mow down all the leading heavy-weights of the
United States and England, with the latest champion
leading the charge.</p>

<p>Now, this regular who won our little wars was not
representative of the people as a whole. He was the
man “down on his luck,” who went to the recruiting
depot. Soldiering became his profession. He was in
a class, like priests and vagabonds. When you passed
him in the street you thought of him as a strange being,
but one of the necessities of national existence.
It did not interest you to be a soldier; but as there
must be soldiers, you were glad that men who would
be soldiers were forthcoming.</p>

<p>When trouble broke, how you needed him! When
the wires brought news of his gallantry you accepted
the deeds of this man whom you had paid as the reflection
of national courage, which thrilled you with
a sense of national superiority. To him, it was in
the course of duty; what he had been paid to do. He
did not care about being called a hero; but it pleased
the public to make him one&mdash;this professional who
fights for a shilling a day in England and $17.50 a
month in the United States.</p>

<p>Though when the campaign went well the public
was ready to take the credit as a personal tribute,
when the campaign went illy they sought a scapegoat,
and the general, who might have been a hero, was
sent to the wilderness perhaps because those busy men
in Congress or Parliament thought that the army could
do without that little appropriation which was needed
for some other purpose. The army had failed to deliver
the goods which it was paid to produce. The
army was to blame, when, of course, under free institutions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451">451</a></span>
the public was to blame, as the public is
master of the army and not the army of the public.</p>

<p>A first impression of the British army is always
that of the regiment. Pride of regiment sometimes
appears almost more deep-seated than army pride to
the outsider. It has been so long a part of British
martial inheritance that it is bred in the blood. In the
old days of small armies and in the later days of small
wars, while Europe was making every man a soldier
by conscription, regiment vying with regiment won
the battles of empire. The memory of the part each
regiment played is the inspiration of its present; its
existence is inseparable from the traditions of its long
list of battle honours.</p>

<p>The British public loves to read of its Guards’ regiment
and to watch them in their brilliant uniforms at
review. When a cadet comes out of Sandhurst he
names the regiment which he wishes to join, instead of
being ordered to a certain regiment, as in West Point.
It rests with the regimental commander whether or
not he is accepted. Frequently the young man of
wealth or family serves in the Guards or another crack
regiment for a while and resigns, usually to enjoy
the semi-leisurely life which is the fortune of his inheritance.</p>

<p>Then there are the county line regiments, such as
the Yorkshires, the Kents, and the Durhams. In this
war each county wanted to read about its own regiments
at the same time as about the Guards, just as
Kansas at home would want to read about the Kansas
regiments and Georgians about the Georgia regiments.
The most trying feature of the censorship to the
British public was its refusal to allow the exploitation
of regiments. The staff was adamant on this point;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452">452</a></span>
for the staff was thinking for the whole and of the
interests of the whole. In the French and the German
armies, as in our regular army, the regiment was
known by a number.</p>

<p>The young man who lives in the big house on the
hill, the son of the man of wealth and power in the
community, as a rule does not go to West Point.
None of the youth of our self-called aristocracy,
which came up the golden road in a generation past
those in modest circumstances who have generations
of another sort back of them, think of going into the
First Cavalry or the First Infantry for a few years
as a part of their career. A few rich men’s sons enter
our army, but only enough to prove the rule by
the exception. They do not regard the army as “the
thing.” It does not occur to them that they ought to
do something for their country. Rather, their country
ought to do something for them.</p>

<p>But sink the plummet a little deeper and these are
not our aristocracy nor our ruling class, which is too
numerous and too sound of thought and principle for
them to feel at home in their company. One boy,
however humble his origin, may go to West Point if
he can pass the competitive examination. Europe,
particularly Germany, would not approve of this; but
we think it the best way. The average graduate of
the Point, whether the son of a doctor, a lawyer, or a
farmer, sticks to the army as his profession. We
maintain West Point for the strict business purpose
of teaching young men how to train our army in time
of peace and to lead and direct it in time of action.</p>

<p>Our future officers enter West Point when they are
two years younger than is the average at Sandhurst;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453">453</a></span>
the course is four years compared with two at Sandhurst.
I should venture to say that West Point is the
harder grind; that the graduate of the Point has a
more specifically academic military training than the
graduate of Sandhurst. This is not saying that he
may be any better in the performance of the simple
duties of a company officer. It is not a new criticism
that we train everybody at West Point to be a general,
when many of the students may never rise above
the command of a battalion. However, it is a significant
fact that at the close of the Civil War every
army commander was a West Point man and so were
most of the corps commanders.</p>

<p>The doors are open in the British army for a man
to rise from the ranks; not as wide as in our army, but
open. The Chief of Staff of the British Expeditionary
Force, Sir William Robertson, was in the ranks for
ten years. No man not a West Pointer had a position
equivalent in importance to his at the close of the
Civil War. His rise would have been possible in no
other European army.</p>

<p>But West Point sets the stamp on the American
army and Sandhurst and Woolwich, the engineering
and artillery school, on the British army. At the end
of four years at West Point the men who survive
the hard course may be tried by courtmartial not for
conduct unbecoming an officer, but an officer and a
gentleman. They are supposed, whatever their
origin, to have absorbed certain qualities, if they were
not inborn, which are not easily described but which
we all recognise in any man. If they are absent it
is not the fault of West Point; and if a man cannot
acquire them there, then nature never meant them for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454">454</a></span>
him. From the time he entered the school the government
has paid his way; and he is cared for until he
dies, if he keeps step and avoids courtmartials.</p>

<p>His position in life is secure. His pay counting
everything is better than that of the average graduate
of a university or a first-class professional school, who
practises a profession. Yet only three boys, I remember,
wanted to go to West Point from our congressional
district in my youth. Nothing could better
illustrate the fact that we are not a military people.
From West Point they go out to the little army which
is to fight our wars; to the posts and the Philippines,
and become a world in themselves; an isolated caste
in spite of themselves. I am not at all certain that
either the British or the American officer works as
hard as the German in time of peace. Neither has
the practical incentive nor the determined driver behind
him.</p>

<p>For it takes a soldier Secretary of War to drive a
soldier; for example, Lord Kitchener. Those
British officers, who applied themselves in peace to the
mastery of their profession and were not content with
the day’s routine requirements, had to play chess without
chessmen; practise manœuvres on a board rather
than with brigades, divisions, corps, and armies.
They became the rallying points in the concourse of
untrained recruits.</p>

<p>German and French officers had the incentive and
the chessmen. The Great War could not take them
by surprise. They took the road with a machine
whose parts had been long assembled. They had
been trained for big war; their ambition and intelligence
were under the whip of a definite anticipation.</p>

<p>A factor overlooked, but even more significant than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455">455</a></span>
training or staff work, was that what might be called
martial team-play had become an instinct with the continental
peoples through the necessity of their situation.
This the Japanese also possess. It is the right
material ready to hand for the builder. Not that it
is the kind of material one admires; but it is the right
material for making a war-machine. One had only
to read the expert military criticism in the British and
the American press at the outset of the war to realise
how vague was the truth of the continental situation to
the average Englishman or American&mdash;but not to
the trained British staff.</p>

<p>So that little British Expeditionary Force, in ratio
of number one to twenty or thirty of the French army,
crossed the Channel to help save Belgium. Gallantry
it had worthy of the brightest chapter in the immortal
history of its regiments from Quebec to Kandahar,
from Waterloo to South Africa, Guards and Hussars,
Highlanders and Lowlanders, kilts and breecks, Connaught
Rangers and Royal Fusiliers, Duke of Wellingtons
and Prince of Wales’ Own, come again to
Flanders. The best blood of England was leading
Tommy Atkins. Whatever British aristocracy is or
is not, it never forgets its duty to the England of its
fathers. It is never ingrate to its fortune. The time
had come to go out and die for England, if need be,
and these officers went as their ancestors had gone
before them, as they would go to lectures at Oxford,
to the cricket field and the polo field, in outward
phlegm, but with a mighty passion in their hearts.</p>

<p>The Germans affected to despise this little army.
It had not been trained in the mass tactics which hurl
columns of flesh forward to gain tactical points that
have been mauled by artillery fire. You do not use<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456">456</a></span>
mass tactics against Boers, nor against Afridis or
Filipinos. It is difficult to combine the two kinds of
efficiency. Those who were on the march to the relief
of the Peking legations recall how the Germans
were as ill at ease in that kind of work as the American
and British were at home. It made us misjudge
the Germans and the Germans misjudge us when they
thought of us as trying to make war on the Continent
of Europe. A small, mobile, regular army, formed
to go over seas and march long distances, was to fight
in a war where millions were engaged and a day’s
march would cover an immense stretch of territory
in international calculations of gain and loss.</p>

<p>For its own purposes, the British Expeditionary
Force was well-nigh a perfect instrument. As quantity
of ammunition was an important factor in transport
in the kind of campaign which it was prepared
for, its guns were the most accurate on a given point
and its system of fire adapted to that end; but the
French system of fire, with plentiful ammunition from
near bases over fine roads, was better adapted for a
continental campaign.</p>

<p>To the last button that little army was prepared.
Man for man and regiment for regiment, I should say
it was the best force that ever fired a shot in Europe;
this without regard to national character. As England
must make every regular soldier count and as
she depended upon the efficiency of the few rather
than on numbers, she had trained her men in musketry.
No continental army could afford to allow its
soldiers to expend the amount of ammunition on the
target range that the British had expended. Only by
practise can you learn how to shoot. This gives the
soldier confidence. He stays in his trench and keeps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457">457</a></span>
on shooting because he knows that he can hit those
advancing figures and that this is his best protection.
The more I learn, the more I am convinced that the
Germans ought to have got the British Expeditionary
Force; and the Germans were very surprised that they
did not get it. With their surprise developed a respect
for British arms, reported by all visitors to Germany.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Atkins, none other, is the hero of that
retreat from Mons. The first statue raised in London
after the war ought to be of him. If there had
been five hundred thousand of him in Belgium at the
end of the second week in August, Brussels would now
be under the Belgian flag. Like many other good
things in this world, including the French army, there
were not enough of him. Many a company on that
retreat simply got tired of retreating, though orders
were to fall back. It dug a trench and lay down and
kept on firing&mdash;accurately, in the regular, business-like
way, reinforced by the “stick it” British character&mdash;until
killed or engulfed. This held back the
flood long enough for the remainder of the army to
retire.</p>

<p>Not all the generalship emanated from generals.
I like best that story of the cross-roads where, with
Germans pressing hard on all sides, two columns in
retreat fell in together, uncertain which way to go.
With confusion developing for want of instructions, a
lone exhausted staff officer who happened along took
charge and standing at the junction in the midst of
shell-fire told every doubting unit what to do, with
one-two-three alacrity of decision. His work finished,
he and his red cap disappeared, and I never
could find any one who knew who he was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458">458</a></span>
After the retreat and after the victory of the
Marne, what was England’s position? The average
Englishman had thought that England’s part in the
alliance was to send a small army to France and to
take care of the German fleet. England’s fleet was
her first consideration; that must be served; France’s
demand for rifles and supplies must be attended to
before the British demand; Serbia needed supplies;
Russia needed supplies; a rebellion threatened in
South Africa; the Turks threatened the invasion of
Egypt. England had to spread her energy out over
a vast empire with an army that had barely escaped
annihilation. Every soldier who fought must be supplied
over seas. German officers put a man on a railroad
train and he detrained near the front. Every
British soldier had to go aboard a train and then a
ship and then disembark from the ship and go aboard
another train. Every article of ordnance, engineering,
medical supply, food supply, must be handled
four times, while in Germany they need be handled
but twice. Any railway traffic manager will understand
what this means. Both the British supply system
and the medical corps were marvels.</p>

<p>Germany was stronger than the British public
thought. Germany and Austria could put at the
front in the first six months of the war practically
double the number which the Allies could maintain.
Russia had multitudes to draw from in reserve, but
the need was multitudes at the front. There she was
only as strong as the number she could feed and equip.
In the first year of the war England suffered 380,000
casualties on land, six times the number of bayonets
that she had at Mons. All this wastage must be met
before she could begin to increase her forces. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459">459</a></span>
length of line on the Western front that she was holding
was not the criterion of her effort. The French
who shared with the British that terrible Ypres salient
realised this.</p>

<p>Aside from the regulars she had the Territorials,
who are much the same as our National Guard and
varied in equality in the same way. Native Indian
troops were brought to France to face the diabolical
shell-fire of modern guns, and Territorials went out to
India to take the place of the British regulars, who
were withdrawn for France. Every rifle that England
could bring to the assistance of the French in
their heroic stand was a rifle to the good.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, she was making her new army. For
the first time since Cromwell’s day, all classes in England
were going to war. Making an army out of the
raw is like building a factory to be manned by expert
labour which you have to train. Let us even suppose
that the factory is ready and that the proprietor must
mobilise his managers, overseers, foremen, and labour
from far and near&mdash;a force individually competent,
but which had never before worked together.
It would require some time to organise team-play,
wouldn’t it? Particularly it would if you were short
of managers, overseers, and foremen. To express
my meaning from another angle in talking once with
an English pottery manufacturer he said:</p>

<p>“We do not train our labour in the pottery district.
We breed it from generation to generation.”</p>

<p>In Germany they have not only been training soldiers,
but breeding them from generation to generation.
You may think that system is wrong. It may
be against your ideals. But in fighting against that
system for your ideals when war is violence and killing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460">460</a></span>
you must have weapons as effective as the
enemy’s. You express only a part of Germany’s preparedness
by saying that the men who left the plough
and the shop, the factory and the office, became
trained soldiers at the command of the staff as soon
as they were in uniform and had rifles. These men
had the instinct of military co-ordination bred in them
and so had their officers, while England had to take
men from the plough and the shop, the factory and
the office, and equip them and teach them the rudiments
of soldiering before she could consider making
them into an army.</p>

<p>It was one thing for the spirit of British manhood
to rise to the emergency. Another and even more
important requisite went with it. If my country ever
faces such a crisis I hope that we also may have the
courage of wisdom which leaves an expert’s work to
an expert. England had Lord Kitchener, who could
hold the imagination and the confidence of the nation
through the long months of preparation, when there
was little to show except repetition of drills here and
there on gloomy winter days. It required a man with
a big conception and patience and authority to carry
it through, and recruits with an unflinching sense of
duty. The immensity of the task of transforming a
non-military people into a great fighting force grew
on one in all its humdrum and vital details as he
watched the new army forming.</p>

<p>“Are you learning to think in big numbers?” was
Lord Kitchener’s question to his generals.</p>

<p>Half of the regular officers were killed or wounded.
Where the leaders? Where the drillmasters for the
new army? Old officers came out of retirement,
where they had become used to an easy life as a rule,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_461">461</a></span>
to twelve hours a day of hard application. “Dugouts”
they were called. Veteran non-commissioned
officers had to drill new ones. It was demonstrated
that a good infantry soldier can be made in six
months; perhaps in three. But it takes seven months
to build a rifle-plant; many more months to make
guns&mdash;and the navy must never be stinted. Probably
the English are slow; slow and thoroughgoing.
They are good at the finish, but not quick at the start.
They are used to winning the last battle, which they
say is the one that counts. The complacency of empire
with a century’s power was a handicap, no doubt.
We are inclined to lean forward on our oars, they to
lean back&mdash;which does not mean that they cannot
lean forward in an emergency or that they lack reserve
strength.</p>

<p>Public impatience was inevitable. It could not be
kept silent; that is the English of it&mdash;the American,
too. We demand to know what is being done. It
was not silent in the Civil War. From the time that
McClellan started forming his new army until the
Peninsula was six months, if I remember rightly.
Von Moltke, who built the German staff system, said
that the Civil War was a strife between two armed
mobs; though I think if he had brought his Prussians
to Virginia a year later, in ’63, which would have
ended the Civil War there and then, he would have
had an interesting time before he returned to Berlin.</p>

<p>The British new army was not to face another new
army, but the most thoroughly organised military machine
that the world has ever known. Not only this,
but the Germans, with a good start and their system
established, were not standing still and waiting for the
British to catch up, so that the two could begin again<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462">462</a></span>
even, but were adapting themselves to the new features
of the war. They had been the world’s arms-makers.
With vast munition plants ready, their
feudal socialistic organisation could make the most of
their resources in men and material.</p>

<p>More than two million Englishmen went to the recruiting
depots, though no invader had set foot on
their soil, and offered to serve in France or wherever
they were needed over seas. If no magic could put
rifles in their hands or summon batteries of guns to
follow them on the march, the fact of their volunteering,
when they knew by watching from day to day the
drudgery that it meant and what trench warfare was,
shows at least that the race is not yet decadent. Perhaps
we should have done better. No one can know
until we try it. If liberal treatment by the government
and the course set by Secretary Root means anything,
our staff ought to be better equipped for such a
task than the English were; this, too, only war can
decide.</p>

<p>Whatsoever of pessimism appeared in the British
press was telegraphed to America. Pessimism was
not permitted in the German press. Imagine Germany
holding control of the cable and allowing press
despatches from Germany to pass over it with the
freedom that England allowed! Imagine Germany
having waited as long as England before making cotton
contraband! The British press demanded information
from the government which the German
press would never have dared to ask. I have known
an American correspondent, fed out of hand in Germany
and thankful for anything that the fearful German
war machine might vouchsafe, turning a belligerent
when he was in London for privileges which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463">463</a></span>
he would never have thought of demanding in Berlin.</p>

<p>If an English ship were reported sunk, he believed
it must be, despite the government’s denial. Did he
go to the Germans and demand that he might publish
the rumours of what had happened to the <i>Moltke</i> in
the Gulf of Riga, or how many submarines Germany
had really lost? Indeed, he was unconsciously paying
a compliment to British free institutions. He expected
more in England; it seemed a right to him, as
it would at home. Englishmen talked frankly to him
about mistakes; he heard all the gossip; and sometimes
he concluded that England was in a bad way.
In Germany such talk was not allowed. Every German
said that the government was absolutely truthful;
every German believed all of its reports. But
ask this critical American how he would like to live
under German rule, and then you found how anti-German
he was at heart. Nothing succeeds like success,
and Germany was winning and telling no one if
she had any setbacks.</p>

<p>If there were a strike, the British press made the
most of it for it was big news. Pessimism is the Englishman’s
natural way of arousing himself to fresh
energy. It is also against habit to be demonstrative
in his effort; so it is not easy to understand how much
he is doing. Then, pessimism brought recruits; it
made the Englishman say, “I’ve got to put my back
into it!” Muddling there was and mistakes, such as
that of the method of attack at Gallipoli; but in the
midst of all this disspiriting pessimism, no Englishman
thought of anything but of putting his back into
it more and more. Lord Kitchener had said that it
was to be a long war and evidently it must be. Of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464">464</a></span>
course, England’s misfortune was in having the war
catch her in the transition from an old order of things
to social reforms.</p>

<p>But if the war shows anything it is that basically
English character has not changed. She still has unconquerable,
dogged persistence, and her defects for
this kind of war are not among the least admirable of
her traits to those who desire to live their own lives
in their own way, as the English-speaking people have

<p>It is still the law that when a company of infantry
marches through London it must be escorted by a
policeman. This means a good deal: that civil power
is superior to military power. It is a symbol of what
Englishmen have fought for with spades and pitchforks
and what we have fought Englishmen for. My
own idea is that England is fighting for it in this struggle;
and starting unready against a foe which was
ready, as the free peoples always have, she was
fighting for time and experience before she could strike
her sturdiest blows.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
